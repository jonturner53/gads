<h1>Basic Data Structures</h1>
<p>
This page describes a number of basic data structures used by the
various algorithms and as building blocks within more complex data structures.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Many of the algorithms described on this site here require multiple
data structures that address different aspects of the problem being solved.
Because the data structures are closely related, there must be a way to
maintain correspondences among them.
One simple way to do this is
with <i>index-based data structures</i>.
Here is an example of an index-based list used to represent the list
of distinct integers $[7,5,3,8,2]$. In general, an index list
can be used to represent any list of distinct positive integers within a bounded
range, in this case, 1 to 10.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="550" src="figs/indexList.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
The list is represented by a vector $\textit{next}$, which identifies the next
item in the list. So for example $\textit{next}[7] = 5$ as you would expect.
Notice that $\textit{next}[2] = 0$ to indicate the end of the list. For the
integers in $1\ldots 10$ that are not in the list,
the value of $\textit{next}$ is $-1$.
This allows us to implement a constant-time test to determine if a given
value is in the list. A list like this could be used to represent a queue
containing some of the vertices in a graph. The linked representation allows
us to easily remove the first element or add a new element to the end,
while the constant-time membership test allows us to quickly determine if
a given vertex is in the queue.
<p>
Here is another example of an index-based data structure, which defines a
collection of disjoint lists that partition the index set $1\ldots 12$ into
the six subsets $\{[1, 6, 3], [4], [2, 7], [8], [11, 9], [5, 12, 10]\}$. This list is doubly-linked with the <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code>
arrays defining the neighbors of each list item.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="600" src="figs/dlists.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Observe that the colors highlight items in the same list.
Also, note that the $\textit{next}$ value for the last item on each list is 0 to mark
the end of the list. However, the $\textit{prev}$ value of the first
item on each list is not 0. Instead, it points to the last item in the list.

All the algorithms and data structures described on the site have been
implemented as <i>javascript</i> modules.
Here is an example of one of the basic algorithms that is available.
It uses the index list data structure and the disjoint lists data structure,
as well as a data structure for an undirected graph.
Note that the code below is enclosed in a scrollable text area.

<p>
The function <code>components</code> identifies the individual
connected components of a graph and returns the number of components,
a <code>Dlists</code> object that has a separate list for the vertices
in each component and a <i>trace string</i> that captures trace information
detailing the steps in the function's execution.
The tracing feature is enabled by the optional <i>trace</i> argument.
Most of the provided code modules include a similar trace feature.
<p>
The <code>Dlists</code> object <code>comps</code> is defined on the integers
1 to <code>g.n</code>, where <code>g.n</code>
is the number of vertices in the <code>graph</code> object <code>g</code>.
The outer loop scans the set of vertices looking for a vertex <code>s</code>
which is not
in any component already identified, while the inner loop implements
a breadth-first search over the component containing <code>s</code>,
combining all of its vertices into a single list in <code>Dlists</code>.
The <code>singleton()</code> method returns true if its argument is the
only item in its list.
The <code>enq()</code> and <code>deq()</code> methods are used to add
an item to the end of a list or remove the first item.
The <code>firstAt()</code> and <code>nextAt()</code> methods are used to
traverse an adjacency list of a graph, while <code>g.mate(u,e)</code>
returns the endpoint of edge <code>e</code> that is not <code>u</code>.
<p>
There is a simple web application that allows you to examine the
code for any of the provided modules and run the code in a browser.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="800" src="figs/grafalgoApp.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
When the app is first opened, the top text area is available
as a scratch pad that you can use to enter and run programs.
To run the <code>components</code> module first enter the following text
in the top window.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
let g = new Graph(10);
g.fromString('{a[b d e] b[a c f] c[b d f] d[a c e] e[a d] f[b c] ' +
             'g[h] h[g i] i[h]}');
log(g);
let [ count, comps ] = components(g)
log(count + ' ' + comps);
</pre>
The <code>fromString</code> method initializes the graph object <code>g</code>
from a string, which specifies the graph as a set of adjacency
lists.
So for example, the initial portion of the provided argument,
(<code>a[b d e]</code>) specifies edges from <code>a</code>
to <code>b</code>, <code>d</code> and <code>e</code>.
The <code>log()</code> method can be viewed as a shorthand for
<code>console.log()</code>. Its output appears in the bottom window.
If you click on the <i>run</i> button at right, the following text
will appear in the lower window.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
{a[b d e] b[a c f] c[b d f] d[a c e] e[a d] f[b c] g[h] h[g i] i[h] j[]}
3 [(a b d e c f), (g h i)]
</pre>
The first line shows the graph as a string. Note that an empty
adjacency list appears for vertex <code>j</code>, which
is included in <code>g</code>, since <code>g</code> was declared to
have 10 vertices.
Also note that 3 components are reported, but only the two non-singleton
components are shown explicitly,
since the <code>toString</code> method of the
<code>Dlists</code> object omits singleton lists for brevity.
The missing component is the isolated vertex <code>j</code>.
<p>
If you replace the last three lines in the top window with
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
let [,,ts] = components(g,1)
log(ts);
</pre>
and click on the <i>run</i> button agin, you will get
<p>
<textarea rows="13" cols="80" readonly
          style="font-size: 95%;background-color:lightCyan">
{a[b d e] b[a c f] c[b d f] d[a c e] e[a d] f[b c] g[h] h[g i] i[h] j[]}
selected vertex, queue, components
a [b d e] [(a b d e)]
b [d e c f] [(a b d e c f)]
d [e c f] [(a b d e c f)]
e [c f] [(a b d e c f)]
c [f] [(a b d e c f)]
f [] [(a b d e c f)]
g [h] [(a b d e c f), (g h)]
h [i] [(a b d e c f), (g h i)]

j [] [(a b d e c f), (g h i)]
</textarea>
<p>
The menus at the top right provide access to all the available code
modules. The first two menus list the data structures
and unit tests for each.
The next two list the algorithms that use those data structures,
along with their unit tests.
When a unit test is displayed, you can run it using the <code>run</code> button.
The last menu provides access to some common code modules.
You can <i>activate</i> a menu by clicking on the button to its
left, causing the selected item to be displayed.
Selecting an item from a different menu activates that menu.
Go back to the scratch pad by clicking on its button.
<p>
If you load the unit test for the components module,
you can run it by clicking on the <i>run</i> button,
The lines
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
let [k, dl, ts] = components(g,1);
assert(k, 3, 'a1');
assert(dl, '[(a b c d e f), (g h i)]', 'a2');
</pre>
run the <code>components</code> function and verify its output.
The <code>assert</code> function verifies that its first two
arguments are equal and prints an error message if they are not.
The error message includes string versions of the
first two arguments so that you can
see why the <code>assert</code> failed.
The third argument is a tag that appears in the error message so
you can more easily identify which call to
<code>assert</code> triggered a given message.
If <code>assert</code> is called with just two argments, the first
is assumed to be a boolean expression.
A failed call to <code>assert</code> also triggers an exception
which terminates the test.
For example, if you change the 3 in the first <code>assert</code>
statement to 2, you will get the message
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
AssertError: a1 3 2 
</pre>
<p>
If you spend some time reviewing the code for the <code>List</code>
and <code>Dlist</code> modules,
you will be able to see for yourself how the data structures are
implemented. You will also find that they share some common methods.
For example, both have <code>toString</code>, <code>fromString</code>
and <code>equals</code>
methods and some underlying machinery to expand the required
storage space as needed.
<p>
The application, is available at
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
www.cse.wustl.edu/~jon.turner/grafalgo/js
</pre>
The provided code is also available as part of the <i>Grafalgo</i>
library, which can be downloaded from
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
https://github.com/jonturner53/grafalgo
</pre>
The library includes <i>C</i>++ implementations of the code described here,
in addition to the <i>javascript</i> version.
The <i>C</i>++ version pre-dates the <i>javascript</i> version.
Do not expect them to fully consistent.
There is also the beginnings of a <i>java</i> version, which may (or may not)
be completed at some point.
<h2>Common Methods</h2>
All the provided data structure have a common super-class <code>Adt</code>,
which defines an index range $1\ldots n$ for some integer $n$ and provides
the following methods.
<ul>
<li> <code>constructor(n=5)</code> constructs an object with an index range
    of <code>n</code>.
<li> <code>n</code> returns the index range of the object.
<li> <code>valid(i)</code> returns true if <code>i</code> is a valid
    index (that is, falls within the index range, or is zero).
<li> <code>toString()</code> is a dummy method which every sub-class
    instantiates. It returns a string representation of the object.
    Many also support two boolean arguments, <code>details</code>,
    <code>pretty</code> and a function argument <code>label</code>.
    These are used to modify the default string that is displayed.
<li> <code>equals(a)</code> returns true if <code>this</code> object
    is equal to the argument <code>a</code>. Most classes define their
    own version of this method, but a default is provided, which compares
    the string representations of the two objects and returns true when
    they are identical. Where class-specific versions are provided,
    they typically support comparison of <code>this</code> object to
    a string argument. In this case, the string is used to
    construct an object, which is then compared to <code>this</code>.
<li> <code>index2string(i, label)</code> creates a string
    representation of the index $i$. Label is an optional function argument.
	If present, it is used to generate the string.
	The default label function uses a lower-case letter in place of the integer
	index value, whenever the index range is $\leq 26$.
	To force numeric values in all cases, use
	<code>index2string(i, x => x)</code>. To use a string from an array
	of tags, use<code>index2string(i, x => tag[x])</code>.
</ul>
Most classes also define the following methods.
<ul>
<li> <code>fromString(s)</code> instantiates an object based on the
    string <code>s</code>.
<li> <code>reset(n, capacity=n)</code> discards the contents of the current
    object and allocates space for for an object with an index range of $n$.
    The optional capacity argument allows extra space to be allocated,
    so that the index range can be increased later, without additional space
    allocation.
<li> <code>expand(n)</code> increases the index range to $n$ and if necessary,
    allocates additional space. The value of the object is preserved.
    To limit the frequency of allocation operations, when a space expansion
    is needed, the space is increased by at least a constant factor of 25%.
<li> <code>assign(x)</code> assigns the value of object <code>x</code> to
    <code>this</code> by copying its contents.
<li> <code>xfer(x)</code> assigns the value of object <code>x</code> to
    <code>this</code> by transferring its contents.
    This effectively destroys <code>x</code>.
<li> <code>clear()</code> clears the value of the object (so for example,
    in the case of a list, the list becomes empty).
</ul>

<a id=list><h2>List and List_d</h2></a>
The <code>List</code> class defines a list of distinct integers in
a limited range $1\ldots n$ and supports the following methods.
<ul>
<li> <code>constructor(n, cap=n)</code> constructs a <code>List</code> object
    with an index range of <code>n</code> and capacity of <code>cap</code>.
    Both arguments may be omitted.
    Initially, the list is empty.
<li> <code>first()</code> returns the first item on the list, or 0 if the list
    is empty.
<li> <code>last()</code> returns the last item on the list, or 0 if the list
    is empty.
<li> <code>next(i)</code> returns the next item in the list following
    <code>i</code> or 0 if <code>i</code> is the last item on the list.
<li> <code>length</code> returns the number of items in the list.
<li> <code>empty()</code> returns true if the list is empty, else false.
<li> <code>at(i)</code> returns the item at position <code>i</code>
    in the list, or 0 if there is no such item.
<li> <code>contains(i)</code> returns true if the list contains <code>i</code>,
    else false.
<li> <code>insert(i, j)</code> inserts item <code>i</code> after item
    <code>j</code>. If <code>j</code> is zero, <code>i</code> is inserted
    before the first item in the list.
<li> <code>deleteNext(i)</code> removes the item following <code>i</code>;
    if <code>i</code> is zero, it deletes the first item;
    the deleted item is returned.
<li> <code>push(i)</code> is an alias for <code>insert(i, 0)</code>.
<li> <code>pop()</code> is an alias for <code>deleteNext(0)</code>.
<li> <code>top()</code> is an alias for <code>first()</code>.
<li> <code>enq(i)</code> is an alias for <code>insert(i, last())</code>.
<li> <code>deq()</code> is an alias for <code>deleteNext(0)</code>.
</ul>
The <code>List</code> is implemented using a single <code>next</code>
array, linking successive list items; items not on the list have 
<code>next</code> values of $-1$.
The <code>at(i)</code> method takes time proportional to the index value.
All others listed above take constant time.
The core methods for the <code>List</code> class are shown below.

<p>
The <code>List_d</code> class extends the <code>List</code> class and
includes the following methods, in addition to those that it inherits.
<ul>
<li> <code>prev(i)</code> is the predecessor of item <code>i</code> in the list.
<li> <code>delete(i)</code> deletes <code>i</code> from the list.
<li> <code>at(i)</code> returns the item at position <code>i</code>, with
    negative integers used to identify items relative to the end of the list.
</ul>

<a id=listPair><h2>ListPair</h2></a>
The <code>ListPair</code> class defines two complementary lists over
the same index range. One is referred to as the <code>in-list</code>,
the other as the <code>out-list</code>.
<ul>
<li> <code>constructor(n, cap=n)</code> constructs a <code>ListPair</code>
    object with an index range of <code>n</code> and capacity of
    <code>cap</code>. Both arguments may be omitted.
    Initially, all items are in the <code>out-list</code>.
<li> <code>isIn(i)</code> returns true if <code>i</code> is in the 
    in-list.
<li> <code>isOut(i)</code> returns true if <code>i</code> is in the 
    out-list.
<li> <code>firstIn()</code> returns the first item in the
    in-list or 0 if the list is empty.
<li> <code>firstOut()</code> returns the first item in the
    out-list or 0 if the list is empty.
<li> <code>lastIn()</code> returns the last item in the
    in-list or 0 if the list is empty.
<li> <code>lastOut()</code> returns the last item in the
    out-list or 0 if the list is empty.
<li> <code>nextIn(i)</code> returns the next item in the
    in-list following <code>i</code> or 0 if <code>i</code> is the last item.
<li> <code>nextOut(i)</code> returns the next item in the
    out-list following <code>i</code> or 0 if <code>i</code> is the last item.
<li> <code>prevIn(i)</code> returns the previous item in the
    in-list following <code>i</code> or 0 if <code>i</code> is the first item.
<li> <code>prevOut(i)</code> returns the previous item in the
    out-list following <code>i</code> or 0 if <code>i</code> is the first item.
<li> <code>swap(i)</code> transfers <code>i</code> from its current list to
    the other.
</ul>
<code>ListPair</code> implements both lists using shared <code>next</code>
and <code>prev</code> arrays. For items in the out-list, the

<a id=dlists><h2>Dlists and Dlists_r</h2></a>
The <code>Dlists</code> class implements a collection of disjoint
lists on a common index set $1\ldots n$.
Each list in the collection is identified by its first list item.
The provided methods are listed below.
<ul>
<li> <code>constructor(n, cap=n)</code> constructs a <code>Dlists</code> object
    with an index range of <code>n</code> and capacity of <code>cap</code>.
    Both arguments may be omitted.
    Initially, each item forms a singleton list.
<li>    <code>isFirst(i)</code> returns true if item <code>i</code> is
        the first item in some list.
<li>    <code>singleton(i)</code> returns true if item <code>i</code> is
        the only item in its list.
<li>    <code>last(i)</code> is the last item in the list identified by
        <code>i</code> (that is, <code>i</code> is the first list item).
<li>    <code>next(i)</code> is the next item on the list containing
        <code>i</code> or 0 if <code>i</code> is the last item.
<li>    <code>prev(i)</code> is the previous item on the list containing
        <code>i</code> or 0 if <code>i</code> is the first item.
<li>    <code>findList(i)</code> returns the first item in the list containing
        <code>i</code>.
<li>    <code>rotate(f, i)</code> rotates the list identfied by <code>f</code>
        to make <code>i</code> the first list item. That is, the portion
        of the list that precedes <code>i</code> is moved to the end of
        the list. It returns <code>i</code>.
<li>    <code>delete(i, f)</code> removes <code>i</code> from the list
        identified by <code>f</code>. The identifier of the
        modified list is returned.
<li>    <code>join(f1, f2)</code> combine the lists identified by 
        <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code> and return the identifier of
        the new list. The new list is the concatenation of the two lists.
        If either argument is 0, the other is returned.
<li>    <code>sort()</code> sorts the items on all lists.
</ul>
<code>Dlists</code> is implemented using shared <code>next</code> and
<code>prev</code> arrays.
The <code>findList(i)</code> method takes time proportional to the
position of item <code>i</code> in the list and the <code>sort</code>
method takes $O(n log n)$ time. All others listed above take
constant time.
The core methods for the <code>Dlists</code> class are shown below.

The <code>Dlists_r</code> class extends the <code>Dlists</code>
class, making the lists efficiently <i>reversible</i>.
It provides the following methods.
<ul>
<li>    <code>isFirst(i)</code> returns true if item <code>i</code> is
        the first item in some list.
<li>    <code>singleton(i)</code> returns true if item <code>i</code> is
        the only item in its list.
<li>    <code>last(i)</code> is the last item in the list identified by
        <code>i</code> (that is, <code>i</code> is the first list item).
<li>    <code>next(i, j)</code> returns the next item on the list containing
        <code>i</code> or 0 if <code>i</code> is the last item.
        The second argument <code>j</code> is the predecessor of <code>i</code>
        in the list, or 0 if <code>i</code> is the first item.
<li>    <code>prev(i, j)</code> returns the previous item on the list containing
        <code>i</code> or 0 if <code>i</code> is the first item.
        The second argument <code>j</code> is the successor of <code>i</code>
        in the list, or 0 if <code>i</code> is the last item.
<li>    <code>findList(i)</code> returns the first item in the list containing
        <code>i</code>.
<li>    <code>rotate(f, i)</code> rotates the list identfied by <code>f</code>
        to make <code>i</code> the first list item. That is, the portion
        of the list that precedes <code>i</code> is moved to the end of
        the list. It returns <code>i</code>.
<li>    <code>delete(i, f)</code> removes <code>i</code> from the list
        identified by <code>f</code>. The identifier of the
        modified list is returned.
<li>    <code>pop(f)</code> is an alias for  <code>delete(f, f)</code>.
<li>    <code>join(f1, f2)</code> combine the lists identified by 
        <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code> and return the identifier of
        the new list. The new list is the concatenation of the two lists.
        If either argument is 0, the other is returned.
<li>    <code>reverse(f)</code> reverses the list identified by <code>f</code>.
        Returns the first item in the reversed list.
</ul>
<code>Dlists_r</code> re-purposes the <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code>
arrays of the <code>Dlists</code> class, using them to represent neighboring
list items, <code>nabor1</code> and <code>nabor2</code>.
If the list predecessor of an item <code>i</code> is known, its
successor can be identified by examining <code>nabor1[i]</code>
and <code>nabor2[i]</code> and selecting the one that does not point
back to the predecessor.
If <code>i</code> is the first item on a list, one of <code>nabor1[i]</code> 
and  <code>nabor2[i]</code> is positive, while the other is negative.
The positive value identifies  <code>i</code>'s successor on the list,
while the negative value identifies the last item on the list.
The list can be reversed by modifying the <code>nabor</code> values
for the first and last items on the list.
The time required for the <code>findList</code> method is proportional
to the length of the list. All other operations take constant time.

<a id=dsets><h2>Dsets</h2></a>

The <code>Dsets</code> class defines a collection of <i>disjoint sets</i>
over the index set $1\ldots n$ and provides methods to efficiently identify
the subset containing a given item and to combine subsets.
Each subset is identified by one of its members.
It provides the following methods.
<ul>
<li> <code>constructor(n, cap=n)</code> constructs a <code>Dsets</code> object
    with an index range of <code>n</code> and capacity of <code>cap</code>.
    Both arguments may be omitted.
    Initially, every item defines a singleton subset.
<li> <code>find(i)</code> returns the item in the set containing
    <code>i</code> that serves as its identifier.
<li> <code>link(i, j)</code> combines the two sets identified by
    items <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> and returns the item
    that identifies the combined set.
</ul>
Each subset in the <code>Dsets</code> object is implemented as a tree,
defined using <i>parent pointers</i>. That is, $p(i)$ identifies the
parent of $i$ in its tree and the root of the tree serves as its
identfier. If $i$ is a root, $p(i)=i$.
This is illustrated below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="600" src="figs/disjointSets.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
The <code>find</code> method follows parent pointers up the tree to
find the root and the <code>link</code> operation combines two trees
by directing the parent pointer of one of the two tree roots to the other,
essentially making one tree a subtree of the other's root.
<p>
Two heuristics are used to make the data structure efficient.
The <i>link-by-rank</i> heuristic defines a
property $rank(i)$ for each item $i$ and uses it when combining
trees to limit the depth of the trees.
Initially, the $rank$ values are 0 and when two trees are linked,
the parent pointer of the tree root with the smaller rank is directed 
to the other root. If the two roots have equal ranks, the rank of
the new root (chosen arbitrarily) is incremented.
This procedure ensures that the maximum depth of a node is
$\lg n$ and that the running time for the <code>find</code> method is
$O(\lg n)$.
<p>
The second heuristic is called <i>path compression</i> and is
implemented as part of the <code>find</code> method.
Specifically, after finding the root of a tree, the <code>find</code> method
makes a second pass over the path, redirecting all of the parent pointers
along the path, so that they point directly to the root.
This speeds up subsequent calls to <code>find</code> and ensures
that any sequence of calls to <code>find</code> and <code>link</code> takes
essentially linear time. A detailed performance analysis is given in the
following subsection.
The core methods for the <code>DSets</code> class are shown below.

<h3>Performance Analysis</h3>
(The analysis in this section is based on Chapter 2 of [Tarjan87].)
Although the disjoint sets data structure is very simple,
fully analyzing its performance is not.
To make it easier to understand, the analysis is presented in several steps,
with each successive step giving a tighter bound on the performance.

<h4>Basic Analysis</h4>

The initialization of the data structure takes $O(n)$ time
and the link operation takes constant time. So, the only question
is how much time is required for the find operations?
This depends on the depth of the tree. We start by noting
that the link-by-rank heuristic ensures that the rank of
any item is strictly less than the rank of its parent.
Consequently, $\textit{rank}(x)$ is
an upper bound on the height of $x$ in the tree.
So, if $x$ is a tree root, the time for a find operation
starting within $x$'s tree is at most $\textit{rank}(x)$.
So, an upper bound on $\textit{rank}(x)$, yields a
bound on the running time of the find operation.
The key to bounding $\textit{rank}(x)$ is to observe that
the number of nodes in $x$'s subtree is at least $2^{\textit{rank}(x)}$.
This can be proved by induction on the number of link
operations, as illustrated below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="800" src="figs/dsetsLemma.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
This implies that if a tree root has rank $k$,
then $2^k \leq n$ and so $k \leq \lg n$.
This implies an $O(\log n)$ bound on the time required for the find operations.
Note that this result does not depend on the path compression heuristic.
Also, note that some find operations can take time proportional to
$\log n$, so there can be no better bound on the time for an
arbitrary find operation.
However, it is possible to get a strong bound on a
sequence of find operations, using a more sophisticated analysis
that takes into account the effects of path compression.

<h4>A  Better Analysis</h4>

As a first step in a more detailed analysis,
let's make a few observations about the ranks.
First, as noted earlier, the rank of a non-root node is strictly
less than the rank of its parent. Also, the rank of a node
can increase as a result of link operations, but it can never decrease,
and once a node becomes a child of another node, its rank can no
longer change.
Finally, $rank(p(x))$ can increase (as a result of either link
operations or find operations that change $p(x)$), but it can
never decrease. These observations are collected in the following lemma.
<p>
<i>Lemma 1</i>.
If $x$ is any node, $\textit{rank}(x) \leq rank(p(x))$ with the
inequality strict if $p(x) \neq x$.
The value of $\textit{rank}(x)$ is initially 0 and increases with
time until $p(x)$ is assigned a value other than $x$.
Subsequently, $\textit{rank}(x)$ does not change.
The value of $rank(p(x))$ is a nondecreasing function of time.
<p>
To facilitate the analysis, consider each find operation as
consisting of a series of <i>find steps</i>, one for each node
along the path followed by the operation.
The objective is to put an upper bound on the total number
of find steps.
Note that the number of find steps at root nodes is
at most $m$, so the remaining analysis considers only find steps
at non-root nodes.
<p>
Define $\Delta(x)=rank(p(x)) - \textit{rank}(x)$ and note that
$\Delta(x) \leq \lg n$ and that
$\Delta(x)=0$ initially and increases,
as $x$ acquires a parent
and participates in find operations.
Also, define a node $x$ to be <i>dominant</i> if $\Delta(x)>2\Delta(y)$
for all proper ancestors $y$ of $x$.
<p>
The analysis can be split into two cases, one covering find steps
that occur at dominant nodes, and the other covering find steps that
occur at non-dominant nodes.
The analysis of the first case rests on the observation that there
can be at most $\lg \lg n$ dominant nodes along the path from 
any node to the root of its tree.
Consequently, each find operation can include at most $\lg \lg n$
find steps at dominant nodes.
Consequently, in a sequence of $m$ find operations,
at most $m\lg\lg n$ find steps occur at dominant nodes.
<p>
Proceeding to the second case, note that if $x$ is not dominant,
then $x$ must have some proper ancestor $y$ with
$\Delta(y) \geq \Delta(x)/2$.
This implies that $rank(p(y))-\textit{rank}(x) \geq 1.5 \times \textit{rank}(x)$
before the find.
After the find completes, $x$'s parent has rank at least as large the
original value of $rank(p(y))$.
Consequently, the find operation causes $\Delta(x)$ to increase
by a factor of at least 1.5.
This is illustrated below.

<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="800" src="figs/dsetsAnalysis1.png"><br>
</div>
<p>

Since every find step that occurs at $x$ at times when $x$ is not
dominant causes $\Delta(x)$ to increase by a factor of 1.5, there can be
fewer than $2 \lg\lg n$ find steps at a node $x$
when it is not dominant. Consequently, the total number
of find steps at non-dominant nodes is $O(n \log\log n)$
and the total number of find steps is $O((m+n)\log\log n)$.

<h4>A Still Better Analysis</h4>

From a practical perspective, there is little reason
to carry the analysis further, since for any practical
value of $n$, $\lg \lg n$ is very small. However, it is
possible to do better and it's instructive to see how.
<p>
The new analysis requires some additional technical machinery.
Rather than go straight to the final analysis, let's
build up to it in several steps, with each step
providing some improvement on what has gone before.
The first step will show that the number of find steps
is at $O(m + n\log\log n)$.
<p>
Start by dividing the non-negative integers
into a series of <i>blocks</i> by defining $block(0)=[0,1]$,
$block(1)=[2,3]$, $block(2)=[4,5,6,7]$ and in general
for $j\geq 1$, $block(j)=[2^j,...,2^{j+1}-1]$.
A node $x$ is said to be <i>on level 1</i> if
there is some $block(j)$ that contains both
$\textit{rank}(x)$ and $rank(p(x))$.
All other nodes are on level 2.
Note that once a node becomes a level 2 node,
it can never again become a level 1 node
(since $\textit{rank}(x)$ does not change once $x$ acquires
a parent and $rank(p(x))$ never decreases).
In the example shown below,
nodes $a$ and $d$ are on level 1, while nodes
$b$ and $c$ are on level 2
A node is called <i>singular</i> if none of its proper ancestors
is on the same level as it is.
So in the example, $c$ and $d$ are singular.

<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="600" src="figs/dsetsAnalysis2.png"><br>
</div>
<p>

As before, the analysis divides into two cases.
The first counts the find steps that occur at singular nodes,
while the second counts the find steps that occur at non-singular nodes.
For the first case, note that any path from a node to the root of its
tree can contain at most one singular node on each of the two levels.
Hence, each find operation includes at most two find steps at singular nodes.
<p>
The find steps at non-singular nodes can be divided into two
sub-cases, one for the find steps involving level 1 nodes and another
for the find steps involving level 2 nodes.
Let's consider the second case first.
Suppose $x$ is a non-singular node on level 2.
Because $x$ is non-singular, it has some ancestor $y$ that is also
on level 2. Because $x$ is on level 2, $rank(p(x))$ is
in a different block than $\textit{rank}(x)$. Similarly,
$rank(p(y))$ is in a different block than $rank(y)$.
Consequently, if we let $z$ be the root of the tree, then
$rank(z)$ is in a different block than $rank(p(x))$.
After the find, $z=p(x)$, so the find operation causes
$rank(p(x))$ to move into a different (and larger) block
than it was in before the find.
Since successive blocks double in size, this can happen at
most $\lg \lg n$ times before $rank(p(x))$ exceeds $\lg n$,
so the number of find steps that can occur at node $x$ while
$x$ is a non-singular node on level 2 is at most $\lg \lg n$.
Hence, the total number of find steps that occur at 
non-singular nodes on level 2 is $O(n\log\log n)$.
<p>
This leaves the case of non-singular nodes on level 1.
Let's suppose that $x$ is such a node and assume that
$\textit{block}(j)$ is the subset of the integers that
includes $\textit{rank}(x)$.
A find involving $x$ will assign a new parent to $x$ causing
$rank(p(x))$ to increase by at least 1.
Since $\textit{block}(j)$ contains $2^j$ values, this can happen
no more than $2^j$ times while $x$ is on level 1.

To bound the total number of find steps at non-singular level 1 nodes, 
the number of nodes in $block(j)$ must be bounded.
This bound, can be obtained with the help of another lemma.
<p>
<i>Lemma 2</i>.
For any integer $k>0$,
the number of nodes of rank $k$ is at most $n/2^k$.
Consequently, the number of nodes with rank $\geq k$ is
less than $2n/2^k$.
<p>
<i>Proof</i>. Suppose that when a node $x$ is assigned a rank of $k$,
all nodes in the tree with root $x$ are labeled $(x,k)$.
By Lemma 1,
at least $2^k$ nodes are labeled when $x$ receives a rank of $k$.
If the root of the tree containing $x$ changes, the new root must have
rank at least $k+1$, so no node is labeled more than once with a
label of the form $(y,k)$ for a particular value of $k$.
Since there are $n$ nodes, there are at most $n$ labels of
the form $(y,k)$ for any particular $k$ and there are at least $2^k$
such labels for each node of rank $k$.
Hence, at most $n/2^k$ nodes can be assigned a rank of $k$. 
Summing $n/2^j$ for all values of $j\geq k$ yields $2n/2^k$,
so the number of nodes with rank $\geq k$ is at most $2n/2^k$.
$\square$
<p>
Now, since a node with rank in $block(j)$ has rank at least $2^j$,
the number of nodes in $block(j)$ is at most $2n/2^{2^j}$.
Consequently, the number of find steps experienced by non-singular
on level 1 with rank in $block(j)$ is at most
$2^{j} \left( 2n/2^{2^j} \right)$.
There are no non-singular nodes with rank in $\textit{block}(0)$,
so if we sum this expression over all values of $j\geq 1$, we get
$$
2n\sum_{j>0} 2^j/{2^{2^j}} \leq 2n\sum_{j>0} j/{2^j} \leq 4n
$$
The first inequality above holds because every term in the summation
on the left-hand side is also present in the summation on the right-hand
side (along with many additional terms).
The second inequality follows directly from the formula for
an unbounded arithmetic-geometric series.
Hence, the number of find steps at non-singular nodes on level 1 is $O(n)$.
Combining this with the results from the other cases we get that
the total number of find steps is $O(m+n\log\log n)$.
<p>
Before proceeding further, let's recap.
In the analysis just completed, the find steps were divided
into three categories.
<ul>
<li> <i>Steps at singular nodes</i>. For each find operation, there are at
    most two of these, for a total of at most $2m$.
<li> <i>Steps at non-singular nodes on level 1</i>. The total number
    of these steps is $O(n)$.
<li> <i>Steps at non-singular nodes on level 2</i>. Each vertex
    experiences at most $\lg \lg n$ of these, for a total
    of at most $n \lg \lg n$.
</ul>
To improve on this result, a better bound on the number of find
steps in the last category is needed.

<h4>An Even Better (but not quite best) Analysis</h4>

The analysis from the last section can be improved by
dividing the case of non-singular nodes on level 2 into two sub-cases.
First let's define a second, coarser partition on
the integers, by letting

\begin{eqnarray*}
\textit{block}(2,0)&=&[0 .. 3] \\
\textit{block}(2,1)&=&[4 .. 15]=\left[2^2 .. 2^{2^2} -1\right] \\
\textit{block}(2,2)&=&[16 .. 65535]=\left[2^{2^2} .. 2^{2^{2^2}} -1\right]
\end{eqnarray*}
and in general
$$
\textit{block}(2,j)=\left[2^{[j]} .. 2^{[j+1]}-1\right]
$$
where $2^{[1]}=2^2$ and $2^{[j]}=2^{2^{[j-1]}}$ for $j>1$.
For notational consistency, let $\textit{block}(1,j)$ denote
the original partition of the integers.
<p>
Now, a node $x$ is defined to be <i>on level 1</i> if
there is some $\textit{block}(1,j)$ that contains both $\textit{rank}(x)$
and $rank(p(x))$.
Node $x$ is defined to be <i>on level 2</i> if it is not on level 1
and there is some $block(2,j)$ that contains both $\textit{rank}(x)$
and $rank(p(x))$.
Nodes that are on neither level 1 nor level 2 are on level 3.
So, in the example below, nodes $a$ and $d$ are on level 1,
$b$ is on level 2 and $c$ is on level 3.
As before, a node is called singular if none of its ancestors
is on the same level that it is.
So, in the example, nodes $b$, $c$ and $d$ are singular.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="650" src="figs/dsetsAnalysis2a.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
As before, the analysis uses a case analysis,
but now, there are four cases to consider.
<ul>
<li> <i>Steps at singular nodes</i>. Since there are just three
    levels, each find operation can have at most
    three find steps at singular nodes.
    This gives a total of at most $3m$ find steps in this category.
<li> <i>Steps at non-singular nodes on level 1</i>. The  previous analysis
    applies directly to this case, so as before, the number of
    find steps for non-singular nodes on level 1 is $O(n)$.
<li> <i>Steps at non-singular nodes on level 2</i>.
    It is shown below that the number of find steps in this group is $O(n)$.
<li> <i>Find steps at non-singular nodes on level 3</i>.
    It is shown below that the number of find steps in this group
    is $O(n\beta(n))$, where $\beta(n)$ is a very slowly growing function.
</ul>

Let's proceed with the analysis of the third case.
Let $x$ be a non-singular node with $\textit{rank}(x)$ in $\textit{block}(2,j)$. 
Because $x$ is on level 2, its parent's rank is in a different
level 1 block than its rank. Because it is non-singular, it has a
proper ancestor $y$ that is also on level 2. 
Consequently, the root of the tree has rank that is in a
different level 1 block than $rank(p(x))$.
This means that a find involving $x$ causes
$rank(p(x))$ to move to a different level 1 block.
Hence, the number of find steps experienced by $x$ while
it is on level 2 and non-singular is less than the
number of level 1 blocks that intersect $block(2,j)$,
and this at most $2^{[j]}-2^{[j-1]}<2^{[j]}$,
as illustrated below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="700" src="figs/dsetsAnalysis3.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Since the number of nodes with rank in $block(2,j)$
is $\leq 2n/2^{2^{[j]}} = 2n/2^{[j+1]}$ for $j>0$,
the number of find steps at non-singular nodes
on level 2 is at most 
$2^{[j]} \left( 2n/2^{[j+1]} \right)$ for $j>0$.
There can be no non-singular nodes on level 2 with
rank in $\textit{block}(2,0)$,
so, the total number of find steps that occur at
non-singular nodes on level 2 is at most
$$
2n\sum_{j>0} 2^{[j]}/{2^{2^{[j]}}} \leq 2n\sum_{j>0} j/2^j \leq 4n
$$

That leaves just the fourth case.
Let $x$ be a non-singular node with $\textit{rank}(x)$ in $\textit{block}(2,j)$. 
Because $x$ is on level 3, its parent's rank is in a different
level 2 block than its rank. Because it is non-singular, it has a
proper ancestor $y$ that is also on level 3. 
Consequently, the root of the tree has a rank that is in a
different level 2 block than $rank(p(x))$.
This means that a find involving $x$ causes
$rank(p(x))$ to move to a different level 2 block.
This means that the number of find steps that $x$ can experience
while it is non-singular and on level 3 is bounded by the number
of level 2 blocks that include values $\leq \lg n$.
If we define $\beta(n)$ to be the smallest integer $i>0$ for which 
$2^{[i]}> \lg n$, then the number of level 2 blocks that includes
values $\leq \lg n$ is $\beta (n)$ and the number of find steps at
any non-singular node on level 3 is at most $\beta(n)$.
The function $\beta(n)$ grows extremely slowly with $n$;
in general $\beta(2^{[k]})=k$.
<p>
Putting together the results from the four cases above,
the total number of find steps is $O(m + n\beta(n))$.
Now it turns out that even this analysis can be improved,
by further sub-dividing the fourth case.

<h4>The Final Analysis</h4>
The key to this final analysis of the number of find steps is to
allow the number of distinct cases to grow further. To do this,
we define a series of partitions on the integers, $block(1,*)$,
$block(2,*)$, $block(3,*)$, and so forth. Each partition is
coarser than the previous one with the last partition requiring very
few blocks to span the range up to $\lg n$.
Specifically, for all $i>0$,
$\textit{block}(i,0)$ starts at 0 and for all
$j>0$, $\textit{block}(i,j)$ starts
with $A(i,j)$, where $A$ is <i>Ackerman's function</i> and is defined as
follows. $A(1,j)=2^j$ for all $j>0$, $A(i,1)=A(i-1,2)$ for all $i>1$ and
$$
A(i,j)=A(i-1,A(i,j-1))
$$
for all $i>1$ and $j>1$.
Notice that with this definition, $A(2,j)=2^{[j]}$ for all $j\geq 1$.
Consequently this definition of the blocks is consistent with the
earlier definition of $\textit{block}(1,*)$ and $\textit{block}(2,*)$.
Now, define a functional inverse $\alpha$ of Ackerman's function.
$$
\alpha(m,n)=\min \{i\geq 1 | A(i,\lfloor m/n \rfloor)>\lg n\}
$$
and note that $\textit{block}(\alpha(m,n),j)$ contains no values $\leq \lg n$
for all $j \geq \lfloor m/n \rfloor$.
<p>
As before, blocks are used to define levels.
Specifically, a non-root node $x$ is defined to be on level 1
if $\textit{rank}(x)$ and $rank(p(x))$ are both in some $block(1,j)$.
For $1 < i\leq \alpha(m,n)$, $x$ is defined to be on level $i$ if it is not
on level $i-1$ and there is some $block(i,j)$ that contains
both $\textit{rank}(x)$ and $rank(p(x))$.
Finally, a node $x$ is on level $\alpha(m,n)+1$ if there is
no $\textit{block}(\alpha(m,n),j)$ that contains both $\textit{rank}(x)$ and
$rank(p(x))$.
We say that $x$ is <i>singular</i> if it has no proper ancestor
on the same level as $x$.
<p>
As before, the analysis can be broken down into cases.
<ul>
<li> <i>Steps at singular nodes</i>. Since there are $\alpha(m,n)+1$ levels,
    the number of find steps at singular nodes is at most
    $m(\alpha(m,n)+1)$.
<li> <i>Steps at non-singular nodes on level 1</i>. The previous analysis
    applies directly to this case, so the number of
    find steps in this case is $O(n)$.
<li> <i>Steps at non-singular nodes on level $i$ for
    $1< i\leq \alpha(m,n)$</i>.
    It is shown below that the number of find steps covered by
    this case is $O(n)$.
<li> <i>Steps at non-singular nodes on level $\alpha(m,n)+1$</i>. 
    A node can experience at most $\lfloor m/n \rfloor$ find
    steps while it is non-singular and on level $\alpha(m,n)+1$.
    Hence the total number of find steps covered by this case is
    $\leq m$.
</ul>
Proceeding with the analysis of the third case,
let $x$ be a non-singular node on level $i$ ($1 < i\leq \alpha(m,n)$)
and assume that $\textit{block}(i,j)$ includes $\textit{rank}(x)$.
Because $x$ is on level $i$, its parent's rank is in a different
level $i-1$ block than its rank. Because it is non-singular, it has a
proper ancestor $y$ that is also on level $i$. 
Consequently, the root of the tree has rank that is in a
different level $i-1$ block than $rank(p(x))$.
Hence, a find involving $x$ causes
$rank(p(x))$ to move to a different level $i-1$ block.
This means that the number of find steps that $x$ can experience
while it is non-singular and on level $i$ is bounded by the number
of level $i-1$ blocks that intersect $\textit{block}(i,j)$.
Call this number $b_{i,j}$ and note that $b_{i,0}=2$ for all
$i$ and that for $j>0$, $b_{i,j} \leq A(i,j)-A(i,j-1)< A(i,j)$,
as illustrated below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="800" src="figs/dsetsAnalysis4.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Since the number of nodes with rank in $block(i,j)$
is $\leq 2n/2^{A(i,j)}$, the number of find steps
experienced by non-singular nodes on level 2 whose
rank is in $\textit{block}(i,j)$ is at most 
$A(i,j) \left( 2n/2^{A(i,j)}\right)$ for $j>0$.
There are no non-singluar nodes with rank in $\textit{block}(i,0)$ for all $i$,
so the total number of find steps experienced by non-singular nodes
on levels 2 through $\alpha(m,n)$ is at most
\begin{eqnarray*}
2n \sum_{2\leq i \leq \alpha(m,n)} \sum_{j>0} A(i,j)/2^{A(i,j)}
&\leq& 2n \sum_{2\leq i \leq \alpha(m,n)} \sum_{j>0} j/2^j \\
&\leq& 2(\alpha(m,n)-1)n \sum_{j>0} j/2^j \\
&\leq& 5(\alpha(m,n)-1) n
\end{eqnarray*}
Combining the bounds in the four cases gives $O((m+n)\alpha(m,n))$
find steps.
<p>
To compare this result with the previous one,
compare the growth rates of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
Note that $\alpha$ grows most quickly when $m=n$. In this case,
$\alpha(n,n)=\min \{i\geq 1 | A(i,1)>\lg n\}$
and applying the definition $\alpha(4,4)=1$,
$\alpha(16,16)=\alpha(2^{[2]},2^{[2]})=2$,
$\alpha(2^{[3]},2^{[3]})=3$ and
$\alpha(2^{[17]},2^{[17]})=4$.
Since $\beta(2^{[5]})=4$, we can see that although $\beta$ is a very
slowly growing function, $\alpha$ grows even more slowly.
Also, it's worth noting that for $m>n \lg \lg n$, $\alpha(m,n)=1$.
So, when the number of find operations grows even a little bit faster
than $n$, the total number of find steps is $O(m+n)$.

<a id=scanner><h2>Scanner</h2></a>
The <code>Scanner</code> class is a utility class used by the various
data structures to implement their <code>fromString</code>  methods.
It is initialized with a string and
provides a variety of helper methods for incrementally parsing that string.
It maintains a <i>cursor</i> that defines the current position
in the string; the cursor is updated as portions of the string are parsed.
<ul>
<li>    <code>constructor(s)</code> initializes the object making $s$ the
        string to be scanned and setting the cursor to 0.
<li>    <code>reset(i=0, s=this.s)</code> resets the object; the
        cursor is reset to <code>i</code> (default value 0)
        and the string is optionally reset to the argument <code>s</code>
        (if <code>s</code> is omitted, the string remains unchanged).
<li>    <code>cursor</code> returns the position of the cursor in the string.
<li>    <code>length</code> is the number of unscanned characters remaining.
<li>    <code>toString()</code> returns the unparsed portion of the string.
<li>    <code>firstNonSpace(i0=0)</code> returns the position of the
        first non-space character starting at the cursor plus <code>i0</code>
        characters.
<li>    <code>skipSpace()</code> advances the cursor to the next non-space
        character.
<li>    <code>isdigit(c)</code> returns true if <code>c</code> is a
        numerical digit.
<li>    <code>islower(c)</code> returns true if <code>c</code> is a
        lower-case letter.
<li>    <code>isupper(c)</code> returns true if <code>c</code> is a
        upper-case letter.
<li>    <code>verify(s, skip=true)</code> returns true if <code>s</code>
        is a prefix of the unscanned portion of the string. If 
        <code>skip==true</code>, the cursor is first advanced to the
        next non-space character. When <code>verify</code> returns true,
        it also advances the cursor past the verified string.
<li>    <code>nextInt()</code> scans the string for an integer
        (possibly signed), skipping
        past leading space characters. If it finds an integer value,
        it returns that value and advances the cursor. Otherwise, it
        returns NaN and leaves the cursor unchanged.
<li>    <code>nextNumber()</code> scans the string for a number (may be
        integer or floating point), skipping
        past leading space characters. If it finds a number,
        it returns its value and advances the cursor. Otherwise, it
        returns NaN and leaves the cursor unchanged.
<li>    <code>nextWord()</code> scans the string for a word
        (an alphanumeric string, possibly including underscores, that
        starts with a non-digit), skipping
        past leading space characters. If it finds a word,
        it returns it and advances the cursor. Otherwise, it
        returns an empty string and leaves the cursor unchanged.
<li>    <code>nextLine()</code> scans the string for a newline character
        and returns the string up to and including the newline.
        If there is no complete line remaining in the string,
        it returns an empty string and leaves the cursor unchanged.
<li>    <code>nextIndex()</code> scans the string for a either a single
        lower-case letter or an integer, skipping
        past leading space characters. If it finds a letter, it returns
        the letter's position in the alphabet
        (1 for $a$, 2 for $b$ and so forth) and advances the cursor.
        If it finds an integer, it returns the integer and advances the cursor.
        Otherwise, it returns 0 and leaves the cursor unchanged.
<li>    <code>nextIndexList(l, ld, rd)</code> scans the string for a
        list of index values (either lower-case letters or integers)
        separated by spaces and delimited by the delimiter characters
        <code>ld</code> and <code>rd</code>.
        The argument <code>l</code> is an array used to return the
        index values. 
        So for example, if the next portion of the
        string in <code>scanner</code> is
        <code>"[ a b 5 )"</code>, then
        <code>scanner.nextIndexList(l, '[', ')')</code>
        returns the array <code>[1, 2, 5]</code>.
        If a valid list is found, <code>l</code> is returned and the
        cursor is advanced.
        Otherwise, <code>null</code> is returned and
        the cursor is left unchanged.
