<h1>Search Trees</h1>

The <i>sorted sets</i> data structure represents a collection of sets,
with each having a numeric <i>key</i>. It supports efficient access to
items based on their key values.
A typical implementation supports the following methods.
<ul>
<li> $\textit{setkey}(i, k)$ sets the key of item $i$ to $k$.
<li> $\textit{access}(k, s)$ returns an item $i$ in set $s$ with key $k$.
<li> $\textit{insert}(i, s)$ inserts item $i$ into set $s$
    and returns the modified set.
<li> $\textit{delete}(i)$ deletes an item $i$ from the set containing it;
    following the operation $i$ is a singleton.
</ul>
Some implementations also support the following methods.
<ul>
<li> $\textit{join}(s_1, i, s_2)$ forms a larger set from a singleton item $i$
    and sets $s_1$ and $s_2$, where $s_1$ is required to have keys $\leq key(i)$
    and $s_2$ is required to have keys $\geq key(i)$.
<li> $\textit{split}(i)$ divides a set into three parts, $s_1$ containing
     items with keys $\leq key(i)$, $s_2$ containing items with keys $\geq key(i)$
    and $i$.
</ul>
Sorted sets can be implemented as a collection of disjoint binary search trees.
If the trees are not explicitly balanced in some way, operations may take
time proportional to the size of the set being operated on.
Balanced variants are more efficient, typically requiring
$O(\log n)$ time per operation.
Here is an example of a single binary search tree.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="250" src="figs/bst.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Note that for each node, the key values in its left subtree are
less than or equal to its key value, while the key values in its
right subtree are greater than or equal to its key value.
To find an item based on its key, compare the target key to the
root key. If the keys match, return the root, if the target key
is smaller, proceed to the left subtree, if it is larger,
proceed to the right subtree. Continuing in this fashion, the
search will eventually reach a node that matches the target key,
if there is one. So for example, a search for a key of 19,
will proceed right, then left, then right, before returning node $l$.
A search for a key of 13 will proceed right, left, left, left
and return null.
<p>
To insert a new item into a search tree, perform a similar search
on the item's key, continuing until the search &ldquo;falls out&rdquo;
of the tree. Insert the new item in that position. This is illustrated below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="250" src="figs/bstInsert.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Deleting an item from a search tree is easy if the item has no children.
Just sever the link to the parent. It is almost as easy if it has one
child, since that child can simply take its parent's place in the tree.
To delete an item with two children, its position in the tree is
first swapped with the &ldquo;rightmost node&rdquo; in its left subtree.
At that point, it has at most one child, making the deletion easy.
This is illustrated below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="500" src="figs/bstDelete.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
The $\textit{join}(s_1, i, s_2)$ operation is easy. Simply make 
$s_1$ the left child and $s_2$ the right child of $i$.
The $\textit{split}(i)$ operation is similarly easy if $i$
is the tree root. If not, the split is accomplished by starting
at item $i$ and proceeding up the tree, forming two subtrees
$l$ containing items with keys $\leq key(i)$ and $r$ containing
items with keys $\geq key(i)$.
<p>
The provided code library includes an unbalanced version
of the sorted sets data type (<code>SortedSets</code>),
an explicitly balanced version (<code>BalancedSets</code>),
and an implicitly balanced verstion (<code>SplaySets</code>).
It also includes an extended version that has a secondary key
(<code>DualkeySets</code>) and supports efficient access to an item with
the smallest secondary key value among the nodes with primary keys
values that do not exceed a specified limit.

<a id=sortedSets><h2>SortedSets</h2></a>
The <code>SortedSets</code> class uses unbalanced binary search trees
to represent a collection of disjoint sets with keys.
In addition to the operations mentioned earlier, it provides convenience
methods for accessing nodes in the neighborhood of a given node;
sibling, left child, right child, parent, grandparent, aunt (parent's sibling),
nephew (&ldquo;further child&rdquo; of sibling) and
neice (&ldquo;nearer child&rdquo; of sibling).
It also provides a <code>find</code> method that returns the id of the set
containing a given item (the tree root) and
methods <code>first</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>last</code>
and <code>prev</code> for iterating through the items in a given set.
For a set of size $k$, the time to iterate through the complete set is $O(k)$.
The core methods from the <i>Javascript</i> implementation are shown below.

To experiment with the code, enter the following into the web app.
<pre style="padding-left:5%;">
let ss = new SortedSets();
ss.fromString('{(b:2 a:1 d:4 c:3) (h:8 g:7 j:10 i:7 f:6) (e:5)}');
log(ss.toString());
ss.delete(7); log(ss.toString());
ss.join(ss.find(1), 5, ss.find(10)); log(ss.toString(1));
ss.split(9); log(ss.toString());
</pre>
This produces the output below.
<pre style="padding-left:5%;">
{(a:1 b:2 c:3 d:4) (e:5) (f:6 i:7 g:7 h:8 j:10)} 
{(a:1 b:2 c:3 d:4) (e:5) (g:7) (f:6 i:7 h:8 j:10)} 
{(((a:1) b:2 ((c:3) d:4)) *e:5 (((f:6) i:7) h:8 (j:10))) (*g:7)} 
{(a:1 b:2 c:3 d:4 e:5 f:6) (g:7) (h:8 j:10) (i:7)}

<a id=balancedSets><h2>BalancedSets</h2></a>
While unbalanced search trees can perform well when subjected to
random inputs, they can also become unbalanced, leading to poor performance.
There are many ways to keep the trees balanced, so that the
height of the trees is $O(\log n)$. One method [Bayer72, Tarjan87] assigns
a <i>rank</i> to every node, so that the ranks satisfy two properties.
$$
rank(u) \leq rank(p(u)) \leq rank(u) +1 \\
rank(u) < rank(gp(u))
$$
where $gp(u)$ is the grandparent of $u$.
Nodes with fewer than two children are assigned a rank of 1.
An example of such a search tree is shown below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="250" src="figs/bstb.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
One can show by induction that any node of rank $k$ has height at
most $2k-1$ and has at least $2^k-1$ descendants.
This implies that the maximum depth of any node
is $\leq 2 \lfloor\lg (n+1)\rfloor$.
<p>
Operations that modify a search tree must be extended to
to ensure that the conditions on the ranks are maintained.
This often requires a <i>rotation</i> operation that restructures the
tree, while maintaining the correct order of the keys.
This is illustrated below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="300" src="figs/bstRotate.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
A rotation at a node $x$ moves $x$ up into the position formerly
occupied by its parent, while the parent moves down into the position
formerly occupied by $x$'s sibling. Rotations are often used in pairs.
In particular, when $x$ is an <i>outer grandchild</i>,
a double-rotation at $x$ consists of a first rotation at its parent,
then a rotation at $x$, as illustrated below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="350" src="figs/bstRotate2a.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
When $x$ is an <i>inner grandchild</i>,
both rotations are done at $x$.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="350" src="figs/bstRotate2b.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Following an insertion of a node $x$, one must compare
$rank(x)$ with $rank(gp(x))$. If $rank(x)$ is smaller,
nothing further needs to be done. If the two ranks are equal,
but $x$'s aunt has smaller rank, the rank conditions can be
satisfied by doing one or two rotations.
Specifically, if $x$ is an outer grandchild,
a single rotation at $p(x)$ completes the process.
If $x$ is an inner grandchild,
a double-rotation at $x$ is required.
This is illustrated below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="400" src="figs/bstbBalanced1.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
If $rank(x)=rank(gp(x))=rank(aunt(x))$, $rank(gp(x))$ is
incremented and the checking procedure is repeated at $gp(x)$
<p>
The procedure for balancing after a deletion is a bit more involved.
It starts at the node $x$ that took the place of the deleted node.
Let $r$ be its rank. There are four case to consider.
(Case 1) If $x$'s parent has rank $r+2$ then there is a
violation of the first rank condition that needs to be fixed.
If $x$'s sibling also has rank $r+2$, a rotation is performed
at the sibling, as illustrated below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="300" src="figs/bstbBal2a.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
This rotation does not fix the rank violation at $x$,
but because $x$'s new sibling has rank $r+1$, the violation can
now be addressed using one of the three remaining cases.
<p>
(Case 2) If $x$'s sibling has rank $r+1$ and both of its children have
rank $r$, then $rank(p(x))$ is decremented, eliminating the rank
violation at $x$, but possibly creating a new violation between
$p(x)$ and its parent. In this case, the checking process is repeated,
with $p(x)$ replacing $x$.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="150" src="figs/bstbBal2b.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
(Case 3) If $x$'s sibling has rank $r+1$ and $x$'s <i>nephew</i>
(the more distant
child of $x$'s sibling) has rank $r+1$, a rotation is performed at
the sibling and the ranks of $x$'s parent and its new grandparent
are changed to $r+1$ and $r+2$ respectively.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="300" src="figs/bstbBal2c.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
(Case 4) Finally, if $x$'s sibling has rank $r+1$
and its <i>neice</i> has rank $r+1$, a double rotation is performed at
the neice and the ranks of $x$'s parent and grandparent
are changed to $r+1$ and $r+2$.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="300" src="figs/bstbBal2d.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Note that the last two cases eliminate the violation at $x$ and create
no new violations, so the rebalancing process ends at that point.
Also, if an application of the first case is followed by an application
of the second case, there can be no remaining violation of the
rank condition at that point.
<p>
The operation $join(s_1,i,s_2)$ can be performed as before,
if $rank(s_1)=rank(s_2)$. In this case, $i$ $rank(i)=rank(s_1)+1$.
If $rank(s_1) \neq rank(s_2)$, things get more complicated.
If $rank(s_1) > rank(s_2)$, the first step is to follow right pointers
from $s_1$ looking for the first vertex $v$ with $rank(v)=rank(s_2)$.
The subtree at $v$ is then replaced with $i$, 
$v$ becomes the left child of $i$, $s_2$ becomes its right child
and $rank(i)$ is set to $rank(v)+1$.
This is illustrated below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="500" src="figs/bstbJoin.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Since this procedure may produce a violation of the second rank condition,
the rebalancing procedure used for inserts is applied at this point,
starting at $i$.
<p>
The <i>split</i> operation is done as before, but uses the balanced
version of the <i>join</i> operation in place of the original.
<p>
The code implementing the core methods of the <code>BalancedSets</code>
class is shown below.

<a id=splaySets><h2>SplaySets</h2></a>
Self-adjusting binary search trees [Tarjan87] offer another way of ensuring
efficient operation. The idea is to restructure trees during normal
tree operations in a way that makes later operations more efficient.
While some individual operations may take more than $O(\log n)$ time,
a sequence of $m$ operations can still be completed in $O(m \log n)$ time.
<p>
The key to this approach is a restructuring operation called a <i>splay</i>.
A splay at a node $u$ consists of a series of double rotations at $u$,
that moves $u$ to the root, or at most one step away. If needed, a
final single rotation is used to bring $u$ to the root.
An example is shown below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="650" src="figs/bstSplay.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
To understand why the splay is helpful,
note that any double-rotation at a node $u$ brings the descendants of $u$
at least one step closer to the root of the search tree.
Consequently, a splay at a node $u$ that is far from the root reduces
the depth of $u$'s original descendants by roughly a factor of two
(possibly more for some of them).
A similar thing happens for $u$'s original ancestors.
Once an ancestor becomes a descendant of $u$, it benefits in the same way.
That is, its distance to the root is reduced by roughly a factor of two.
Even a node $p$ that is not an ancestor of $u$ can benefit, since it also
starts moving closer to the tree root, once $u$ passes $p$'s ancestor on
the original path from $u$ to the root.
<p>
When an <i>access</i> operation reaches a node with the target key,
a splay is performed at that node, improving the performance of future
operations while only increasing the cost of the access by a small
constant factor.
Similarly, a splay is performed after a node is inserted or deleted.  
No splay is performed during a <i>join</i>, but a <i>split</i>
is implemented by first performing a splay at the split node $u$ and
then simply separating the two subtrees of the new root, $u$.
<p>
An amortized complexity analysis can be used to show that the time
required to do a sequence of $m$ operations on a collection of
splay trees is $O(n + m\log n)$ or $O(m\log n)$ in the common case
where $m\geq n$.
As usual, operations are paid for with credits and any excess
credits not needed for a particular operation can be carried over
to pay for future operations.
To ensure that there are always enough credits on hand,
the following credit policy is used.
<p style="padding-left:5%;">
For each node of $u$, maintain $rank(u)$ credits, where
$$rank(u)= \lfloor \lg (\textrm{the number of descendants of }u)\rfloor$$
<p>
To determine the number of credits needed for a splay at node $u$,
let's first determine the number needed for one double-rotation.
Let $v$ be the parent of $u$ and $w$ its grandparent and let
$rank'$ denote the rank values after the rotation
(note that $rank'(u)=rank(w)$).
The number of credits needed to satisfy the credit policy following a double
rotation is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
(rank'(u)-rank(u)) &+& (rank'(v)-rank(v)) + (rank'(w)-rank(w)) \\
&=&(rank'(w)+rank'(v)) - (rank(u)+rank(v)) \\
&\leq& 2(rank(w) - rank(u))
\end{eqnarray*}
If $rank(u) < rank(w)$ and $3(rank(w) - rank(u))$ credits are allocated
for the double rotation, there will be at least one credit available
to pay for the operation, while still satisfying the credit policy.
<p>
Now consider the case where $rank(u)=rank(w)$.
If $u$ is an inner grandchild, then after the double-rotation,
$v$ and $w$ are its children, meaning that at least one of them has a smaller
rank after the operation. This implies that there is one less credit needed to
satisfy the credit policy after the operation, and this credit can
be used to pay for it.
If $u$ is an outer grandchild, then $u$ has at least $2^r$ descendants and 
$w$ has has fewer than $2^r$ descendants outside of $u$'s subtree.
This implies that after the operation $w$ has fewer than
$2^r$ descendants, making $rank'(w) < r$.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="400" src="figs/bstCredit1.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
So again, one less credit is needed to satisfy the credit policy and
that credit can be used to pay for the operation.
Summarizing, if $3(rank(w)-rank(u))$ credits are allocated to each
double rotation, the operation can be paid for while continuing to
satisfy the credit policy.
<p>
If a single rotation is required to complete a splay, the number of
credits needed to satisfy the credit policy after the operation is
$$
(rank'(u)-rank(u)) + (rank'(v)-rank(v)) 
=rank'(v) - rank(u) \leq rank(v) - rank(u)
$$
If $3(rank(v) - rank(u))+1$ credits are allocated for the rotation,
it can be paid for while still satisfying the credit policy.
These observations are summarized in the following lemma.
<p>
<i>Lemma</i>. Let $u$ be a node in a tree with root $v$.
If $3(rank(v)-rank(u))+1$ credits are allocated to a splay operation
at $u$, the operation can be fully paid for while continuing to
satisfy the credit policy.
<p>
Note that this implies that at most $3\lfloor \lg n \rfloor+1$ credits
are needed for each splay.
The next step in the analysis of splay trees is to determine the number
of credits that must be allocated to each operation in addition to those
required for splays.
For an <i>insert</i> operation, the nodes along the path from the inserted
node to the root all acquire a new descendant and consequently,
the ranks will increase for those nodes that have
exactly $2^k-1$ descendants before the insertion.
There are at most $\lfloor \lg n \rfloor+1$ such nodes, so the
total number of credits needed for the insert (including the splay) is
$\leq 4(\lfloor \lg n \rfloor)+3$. 
<p>
The <i>join</i> requires an additional $\lfloor \lg n \rfloor+1$ credits to
satisfy the credit policy at the new tree root,
and since no splay is involved, $\lfloor \lg n \rfloor+2$ credits are
sufficient to pay for the operation
while continuing to satisfy the credit policy.
<p>
The other operations require just one credit beyond those needed for
the splay, so the total number of credits required for $m$ operations
is $O(m\log n)$. The initialization can be paid for with $n$ credits and
no additional credits are needed to satisfy the credit policy initially.
Since every operation is paid for with allocated credits and the number of
credits allocated is $O(n + m \log n)$, the time required for the operations
is also $O(n + m \log n)$.
<p>
The splay lemma is also true using a more general
definition of the $rank$. Specifically, if each node $u$ is assigned some
arbitrary <i>weight</i> $w(u)$ and $tw(u)$ is defined as the total weight
of the subtree with root $u$, then $rank(u)$ can be defined as
$\lfloor \lg tw(u) \rfloor$. The argument used earlier still works with
this definition. The more general version is used in a later section
to analyze the performance of the dynamic trees data structure.

<a id=dualkeySets><h2>DualkeySets</h2></a>

A dual key search tree is an extension of a binary search tree that
includes a secondary key for each node $u$, referred to as $key_2(u)$.
The search tree is still organized around the primary key values,
but the data structure also provides a method
$\textit{findmin}(limit)$ that returns an item of minimum $key_2$ value
from among the items with primary key values $\leq limit$.
Hence, it can be viewed as a generalization of the heap data structure.
It can be implemented using an auxiliary field $min_2(u)$ that gives
the smallest $key_2$ value in the subtree of node $u$.
An example appears below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="400" src="figs/dualkey.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
The <i>findmin</i> operation can be implemented by first identifying the
<i>boundary</i> between the nodes with primary keys $\leq limit$ and
those with primary keys $>limit$.
If $u$ is a node with primary key $\leq limit$, the subtree consisting of $u$
plus its left subtree is referred to as an eligible subtree.
If $u$ is a node with primary key $> limit$, the subtree consisting of $u$
plus its right subtree is referred to as an ineligible subtree.
Note, that the target of a search will never be in an ineligible subtree,
so there is no need to examine them.
Also, given a list of eligible subtrees, it's only necessary to
search one of the eligible subtrees, given the $min_2$ values.
So, in the example given above, if $limit=15$, then $a$ and $j$ both
define eligible subtrees and $d$ and $e$ both define ineligible subtrees.
The node with the smallest $key_2$ value can be found by searching
the left subtree of $a$.
<p>
Note that rotation operations must be extended
to update $min_2$ value. Also, $insert$, $delete$ and $join$ must be
modified to update the $min_2$ values. This can be done by traversing a
path from a node to the root, updating $min_2$ values along the way.
<p>
The provided <i>Javascript</i> implementation extends the
<code>BalancedSets</code> class, so all operations are $O(\log n)$.
The core methods are shown below.
