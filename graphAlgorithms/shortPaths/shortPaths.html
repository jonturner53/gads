<h1>Shortest Paths<sup>&copy;</sup></h1>

(This chapter is loosely based on Chapter 7 of [Tarjan87].)
Let $G = (V,E)$ be a directed graph (<i>digraph</i> for short)
and let <i>length</i> be a real-valued function on $E$.
The <i>length of a directed path</i> in $G$ is defined to be the sum of the 
lengths of its edges. So for example, the
length of the path $c$, $a$, $b$, $g$ in the example below is 14.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="23%" src="figs/spath.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
A <i>shortest path</i> joining a pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ is defined
as a path of minimum length among all paths from $u$ to $v$.
So for example, the highlighted path $a$, $e$, $d$, $f$ in the example above
is a shortest path from $a$ to $f$, but the path $a$, $b$, $g$, $f$ is not.
If there is a directed path from a vertex $u$ to a vertex $v$, then $v$
is said to be <i>reachable</i> from $u$. Note that some vertex pairs
may not be connected by any directed path, even when the underlying
undirected graph is connected.
The distance from $u$ to $v$ is defined to be infinite when $v$
is not reachable from $u$.
<p>
The shortest path problem has many applications. For example, it is used
to determine the best way to forward packets in the internet, and by
mapping applications, to determine the shortest driving distance between
two locations. It also arises in less obvious forms, and often appears as
a subproblem within other problems.
<p>
There are several variants of the shortest path problem. The simplest is the
<i>single pair problem</i>, in which there is a given <i>source</i> vertex
$s$ and a <i>sink</i> vertex $t$  and the objective is find a shortest path
from $s$ to $t$.
In the <i>single source problem</i>, the objective is to find shortest
paths from a given source $s$ to every reachable vertex.
In the <i>single sink problem</i>, the objective is to find shortest
paths to a sink $t$ from every vertex from which $t$ is reachable.
Finally, in the <i>all pairs problem</i>, the objective is to
find shortest paths between every of vertices joined by a path.
<p>
It turns out that solving the single pair problem generally requires solving
a single source (or single sink) problem.
Also, the single source and single sink problems are essentially the same,
and the all pairs problem can be solved by solving the single source problem
multiple times.
Hence, it makes sense to focus on the single source version of the problem.
<p>
Note that edges are allowed to have negative lengths, which means that
shortest paths may have negative lengths as well.
This introduces the possibility that a graph might contain a cycle of negative
length, in which case shortest paths are not well-defined (since one
can produce a path of arbitrarily small length by traversing a negative
cycle multiple times). This means that extra care is needed when
dealing with graphs that have negative edge lengths.
<p>
You might wonder why negative edge lengths are allowed in the first place.
While many applications of shortest paths do not require negative edge lengths,
there are others where they are useful or even essential.
Indeed, shortest path computations are used in algorithms for the
<i>minimum cost flow</i> problem and in this context, negative edge lengths
are an unavoidable feature of the problem.

<h2>Properties of Shortest Paths</h2>
Note that if $t$ is reachable from $s$ and
there is no negative cycle on any path from $s$ to $t$,
then there must be a <i>simple path</i> of minimum length,
since a simple cycle of non-negative length can always removed from
a path without increasing its length. So in the example below,
the shortest path $s$, $a$, $b$, $c$, $a$, $t$ can
be replaced with the simple shortest path $s$, $a$, $t$ by removing the
non-negative cycle $a$, $b$, $c$.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="20%" src="figs/simplePath.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
These observations yield the following basic theorem.
<p>
<i>Theorem 1</i>.
Let $G$ be digraph with a path from $s$ to $t$. 
There is a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ if and only if no path from
$s$ to $t$ contains a negative cycle.
If there is a shortest path from $s$ to $t$, there is one that is simple.
<p>
Solutions to the single source problem can be expressed conveniently using
a <i>shortest path tree</i>. A <i>directed spanning tree</i> of a graph is a
directed subtree that includes a directed path from its root
$s$ to every vertex that is reachable from $s$.
A shortest path tree is a directed spanning tree
in which all paths are shortest paths.
By Theorem 1, a shortest path tree rooted at $s$ exists if an only if
there are no negative cycles reachable from $s$.
So for example, the heavy weight
edges in the example below form a shortest path tree rooted at $a$.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="25%" src="figs/sptree.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Note that if $G$ has a shortest path tree with root $s$, then it contains
a shortest path from $s$ to every vertex reachable from $s$.
Similarly, if $G$ has shortest paths to every reachable vertex,
one can use those paths to construct a shortest path tree.
Simply take a set of paths $P$ containing one path from $s$ to each
reachable vertex. Let $H$ be the graph defined by the union of the
edges in $P$&rsquo;s paths. Now, for each vertex with more that one incoming
edge, remove all but one. The resulting graph is a shortest path tree.
This yields the following theorem.
<p>
<i>Theorem 2</i>.
$G$ contains shortest paths from $s$ to every vertex reachable from
$s$ if and only if it contains a shortest path tree with root $s$. 
<p>
Shortest path trees have an important property that can be
used to define a shortest path algorithm.
Let $T$ be a directed spanning tree of $G$ with root $s$, and
let $\distance(u)$ be the length of the path from $s$ to $u$ in $T$
or infinity if $u$ is not reachable from $s$.
Consider an edge $(u,v)$ in $G$ that is not in $T$ and note that
if $\distance(v)>\distance(u)+\length(u,v)$,
then the tree path from $s$ to $u$ is not a shortest path.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="20%" src="figs/sptProp.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Hence, if $T$ is a shortest path tree,
$\distance(v)\leq\distance(u)+\length(u,v)$
for all edges $(u,v)$ in $G$. 
<p>
What about the converse? That is, if
$\distance(v)\leq\distance(u)+\length(u,v)$
for all edges $(u,v)$ in $G$, does that imply
that all paths in $T$ are shortest paths?
The converse can be confirmed by
showing that for any path $p$ in $G$ from $s$
to a vertex $x$, $\distance(x)\leq\length(p)$.
Note that if $p$ consists of a single edge $(s,x)$, then
$$
\length(p)=\distance(s)+\length(s,x)\geq \distance(x)
$$
<p>
So, let's try to prove the general result using induction on the number of
edges in $p$.
Assume then that $p$ has $k+1$ edges and that 
for all vertices $x'$ and all paths $p'$ with $k$ edges,
$\distance(x')\leq \length(p')$.
Now, let $q$ be the path consisting of the first $k$ edges of $p$
and let $y$ be the last vertex in $q$.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="30%" src="figs/sptProof.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Then,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\distance(x)&\leq&\distance(y)+\length(y,x) \\
&\leq&\length(q)+\length(y,x) \\
&=&\length(p)
\end{eqnarray*}
This yields the following theorem.
<p>
<a id="sptTheorem"><i>Theorem 3</i></a>.
Let $T$ be a directed spanning tree of $G$ with root $s$, and
let $\distance(u)$ be the length of the path from $s$ to $u$ in $T$.
$T$ is a shortest path tree if and only if, 
$\distance(v)\leq\distance(u)+\length(u,v)$
for all edges $(u,v)$ in $G$.
<p>
The property described in Theorem 3 is called the
<i>shortest path tree property</i> and immediately
suggests the following strategy for computing shortest paths.
First, construct a directed spanning tree rooted at $s$, then while
there exists an edge $(u,v)$ that violates the inequality,
replace the tree edge entering $v$ with $(u,v)$.
If there is a shortest path tree rooted at $s$, this process will
eventually find it. However, if there is a negative cycle reachable
from $s$, the procedure will never terminate.
The next section describes a general method for computing
shortest paths based on this approach.

<h2>General Methods for Shortest Paths</h2>
The <i>labeling method</i> builds a directed subtree incrementally
and transforms it to a shortest path tree by identifying edges that
violate the shortest path tree property and modifying the tree to eliminate
those violations.
It uses two mappings, a <i>parent</i> mapping that maps a vertex $u$ to $p(u)$,
its tentative parent in the current subtree, and a
<i>distance</i> mapping that maps vertex $u$ to $\dist(u)$,
the distance from the source vertex to $u$ in the current subtree.
Initially, $p(u)=\textit{null}$ for all $v$ and $\dist(u)=\infty$
for all $u$ except the source $s$, for which $\dist(s)=0$.
It then repeatedly applies the following labeling step.
<p style="padding-left:5%;">
Select an edge $(u,v)$ with
$\dist(v) > \dist(u) + \length(u,v)$;
let $p(v) = u$ and
$\dist(v) = \dist(u) + \length(u,v)$.
<p>
If there is a shortest path tree at $s$, then when the labeling method halts,
its parent pointers define a shortest path tree and the <i>dist</i> values match
the path lengths in the tree. The proof can be found in Chapter 7 of [Tarjan87].
<p>
Note that the edge selection method is crucial to the design of efficient
algorithms based on the labeling method. For example, in the graph shown
below, if the shortest edges are selected first
the number of labeling steps is $3(2^3 -1) = 21$.
The example can be easily extended to yield
graphs on $2k+1$ vertices that require $3(2^k-1)$ steps.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="30%" src="figs/badCaseLabel.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Most algorithms for computing shortest paths apply the
labeling step to all the edges leaving a given vertex before
moving on to other edges. In this approach, vertices are placed in one
of three states: <i>unlabeled</i>, <i>labeled</i> and <i>scanned</i>.
Initially, the source is labeled and all others are unlabeled.
The algorithm then repeats the following <i>scanning step</i>.
<p style="padding-left:5%;">
Select a labeled vertex $u$ and for all edges $(u,v)$ with
$\dist(v) > \dist(u) + \length(u,v)$;
let $p(v) = u$ and
$\dist(v) = \dist(u) + \length(u,v)$ and
make the state of $v$ labeled.
On completion of the scanning step, the state of $u$ becomes scanned.
<p>
The method halts when there are no labeled vertices.
Observe that since a scanned vertex reverts to the labeled state whenever
its distance label changes, this is just a specific version of the
labeling method.
Different algorithms can be obtained by using different methods
for selecting the vertex to be scanned next.
When applied to the previous example, this method uses no more than one
labeling step per edge, regardless of how vertices are selected.
<h2>Shortest Path Tree Algorithms</h2>
Before considering an algorithm that handles the general case,
let's focus on two special cases of graphs with no negative cycles.
The first of these is acyclic graphs. By scanning the vertices in
topological order (in topological order, a vertex $u$ precedes a vertex $v$
if there is a path from $u$ to $v$),
one can ensure that no vertex need ever be scanned
more than once. Consequently, the running time is $O(m)$.
Here is a <i>Javascript</i> version of this algorithm, along with a
function that implements a topological sort.

Next, let's consider an algorithm that can be applied to any
graph with no negative edges. This algorithm selects the labeled vertex
with the smallest tentative distance label and is known as
<i>Dijkstra's algorithm</i> [Dijkstra59].
It is generally implemented using a heap
of labeled vertices, as suggested by Johnson [Johnson77].
This implementation is very similar to Prim's algorithm for the
minimum spanning tree.
If the graph has no negative edge lengths, it can be shown that
the vertices are scanned in the order of their shortest path distances
from the source. Since no vertex is scanned more than once,
the running time is $O(m \log_d n)$ when implemented with an array heap
with $d=2+\lfloor m/n \rfloor$,
and $O(m + n \log n)$ when implemented with a Fibonacci heap.
A <i>Javascript</i> version is shown below. 
<p>
<textarea id="components" rows="15" cols="80" readonly

    dist[s] = 0; border.insert(s, 0);
    while (!border.empty()) {
        let u = border.deletemin();

            if (dist[v] > dist[u] + g.length(e)) {
                dist[v] = dist[u] + g.length(e); link[v] = e;
                if (border.contains(v)) border.changekey(v, dist[v]);
                else border.insert(v, dist[v]);
            }
        }
    }
    return [link, dist, ..];
}
</textarea>
<p>
The performance of Dijkstra's algorithm directly mirrors Prim's algorithm.
The example below demonstrates the worst-case performance.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="50%" src="figs/hardcaseDijkstra.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
In this graph,
the vertices are scanned from left to right and the vertices are all
inserted into the heap in the first iteration of the main loop.
On subsequent iterations, a <i>changekey</i> is performed for every
edge examined and if the edges are examined in decreasing order of length,
each <i>changekey</i> moves a vertex from the bottom of the heap to the top.
<p>
Finally, let's consider an algorithm that can handle the general case.
This algorithm scans the vertices in breadth-first order.
More precisely, it maintains a queue of labeled vertices and
at each step, the first vertex in the queue is removed from the queue and
scanned; any newly labeled vertices are added to the end of the queue.
To evaluate the performance of this approach, it's helpful to divide
the execution into
a series of <i>passes</i>, where a pass ends, when all vertices on the
queue at the start of the pass have been scanned.
If the first pass is pass 0, then at the start of pass $k$,
all vertices $u$ that have a shortest path from the source
consisting of $k$ edges have $dist(u)$ equal to the length
of that path. This can be established by induction on the length
of the path. Consequently, if there is a shortest path tree rooted
at the specified source vertex,
the program terminates after no more than $n$ passes.
Since each edge is processed at most once per pass,
the algorithm halts in $O(mn)$ time.
<p>
Note that if the breadth-first scanning does not halt after $n$ passes,
it will never halt, as there must be some negative cycle reachable from the
source. The simplest way to handle this is to simply count passes and
terminate with a failure if the number of passes exceeds $n$.
This algorithm was discovered independently by Bellman [Bellman58]
and Moore [Moore59] and is referred to here as the
Bellman-Moore algorithm.
A <i>Javascript</i> version appears below.

<p>
This implementation has a special feature. When the specified source
vertex is 0, it computes distances as if there were a separate
source vertex with a zero length edge to every other vertex.
This is useful for detecting the presence of negative cycles anywhere
in the graph using a single shortest path tree computation.
It can also play a role in solving the all-pairs shortest path problem,
as discussed in the next section.

<h2>All Pairs Shortest Paths</h2>
The all-pairs problem for graphs with non-negative edge lengths can be solved
efficiently by repeatedly applying Dijkstra's algorithm. For graphs with
negative edge lengths, one can also use Dijkstra's algorithm by first
transforming the edge lengths to a set of non-negative lengths for which
every path joining two vertices $u$ and $v$ has its length shifted
by the same amount. Consequently, shortest path distances for the
orignal set of lengths can be computed using shortest path distances
for the transformed edge lengths.
<p>
The edge-length transformation is computed by first computing a shortest
path tree in an augmented version of the original graph. The augmented
version simply adds a source vertex $s$ with a zero length edge to every other
vertex. For each vertex $u$ in the orignal graph, define $\distance(u)$
to be the length of the shortest path from $s$ to $u$ in this augmented graph.
Then for each edge $(u,v)$ in the original graph, let
$$
\length'(u,v) = \length(u,v) +
\distance(u) - \distance(v)
$$
Note that if there a shortest path tree rooted at every vertex,
the shortest path tree theorem implies that $\length'(u,v)>0$.
For any path $p$ from $u$ to $v$, one can show (by induction on the path length)
that
$$
\length'(p) = \length(p) +
\distance(u) - \distance(v)
$$
Since the lengths of all $u$-$v$ paths are shifted by the same amount,
a shortest path tree computed with the transformed lengths is also
a shortest path tree in the graph using the original lengths.
This transformation was defined by Edmonds and Karp.
An example is shown below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="50%" src="figs/spathTransform.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
<p>
The shortest path tree can be computed using the Bellman-Moore algorithm.
Since this runs in $O(mn)$ time, the overall running time is dominated
by the $n$ repetitions of Dijkstra's algorithm.
A <i>Javascript</i> implementation of the algorithm
(referred to here as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm) is shown below.
Note that results are returned as an array of shortest path trees
and a corresponding array of distances.

The algorithm can be run in the web app's scratchpad by entering the
following text.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
let g = new Digraph();
g.fromString('{a[b:3 d:-2 f:4] b[c:7 e:4 f:1] c[d:1 f:2] ' +
             'd[b:1 e:3] e[a:5 b:1] f[c:3 d:1 e:-2]}' );
let [link, dist, traceString] = allpairsEK(g, 10, true);
log(traceString);
</pre>
This produces the result shown below.

Floyd's algorithm is an alternate algorithm for the all-pairs
problem that takes $O(n^3)$ time.
For dense graphs, it can be substantially faster than Edmonds-Karp,
since it has extremely low overhead.
Suppose $G=(V,E)$ where $V=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$.
Define $d(i,j,k)$ to be the length of the shortest path from $v_i$ to $v_j$
that passes only through intermediate vertices in the set $\{v_1,\ldots,v_k\}$.
Observe that
$$
d(i,j,0) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0 & \textrm{if $i=j$} \\
length(v_i,v_j) & \textrm{if $i\neq j$ and $(v_i,v_j)$ is an edge} \\
\infty & \textrm{if $i\neq j$ and $(v_i,v_j)$ is not an edge} \\
\end{array}
\right.
$$
and for $k>0$,
$$
d(i,j,k)=\min(d(i,j,k-1),d(i,k,k-1)+d(k,j,k-1))
$$
Floyd's algorithm uses this recurrence to compute shortest path distances.
It starts by computing
$d(i,j,1)$ for all values of $i$ and $j$, then repeats this process to obtain
$d(i,j,2)$ for all $i$ and $j$, continuing in this fashion until
it has computed $d(i,j,n)$.
A <i>Javascript</i> implementation is shown below.

To compare the performance of Edmonds-Karp and Floyd's algorithm,
enter the following text into the web app.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
let g = randomDigraph(100,99);
g.randomLengths(randomInteger, -5, 999);
try {
    let t0 = Date.now();
    let [link, dist, ,stats] = allpairsEK(g);
    let t1 = Date.now();
    log(t1-t0 + ' ms', JSON.stringify(stats));
} catch(e) {
    log(e)
}

try {
    let t0 = Date.now();
    let [link, dist, ,stats] = allpairsF(g);
    let t1 = Date.now();
    log(t1-t0 + ' ms', JSON.stringify(stats));
} catch(e) {
    log(e);
}
</pre>
This produces the output shown below.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
52 ms {"stepsBM":13959,"stepsD":515850} 
19 ms {"steps":1000000,"updates":69276} 
</pre>
Note that this example uses a complete graph,
so it's not surprising that Floyd's algorithm
is substantially faster than Edmonds-Karp.
The two statistics shown for Edmonds-Karp are the
number of steps performed by the Bellman-Moore algorithm
and the number of steps performed by Dijkstra's algorithm
(counting the siftup and siftdown steps in the heap).
This makes it clear that Dijkstra's algorithm dominates
the computation.
The statistics shown for Floyd's algorithm are the
total steps in the inner loop and the number of steps that
produce a change in the distance values.
If the edge density is reduced to 10 edges per vertex,
the results are
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
11 ms {"stepsBM":1061,"stepsD":207626}
21 ms {"steps":1000000,"updates":46204}
</pre>
Edmonds-Karp is now faster than Floyd's algorithm,
which is largely unaffected by
the reduction in the edge count.
