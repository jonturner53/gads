<h1>Edge Coloring<sup>&copy;</sup></h1>

An <i>edge coloring</i> in an undirected graph is a function
that maps each edge to a <i>color</i>, where no vertex is incident
to more than one edge of the same color.
The objective is to color the edges using the smallest number of colors.
An example is shown below where the edge colors are shown as
positive integers.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="20%" src="figs/ecolor1.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Note that the edges assigned any specific color form a matching and
that since the maximum vertex degree in the example is 4, no coloring
can use fewer than 4 edges.
In fact, <i>Vizing's theorem</i> [BM76] states that the number of colors
needed to color any simple graph is either $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$,
where $\Delta$ is the maximum vertex degree.
Edge coloring is NP-complete for general graphs, but for
bipartite graphs, the number of colors needed is exactly $\Delta$.
<p>
For bipartite graphs, one can color the edges by repeatedly 
constructing a maximum degree matching, assigning a new color to all
its edges and then removing the matching edges before proceeding
to the next iteration. This yields an $O(\Delta m n^{1/2})$ algorithm.

<h3>Path Recoloring Method</h3>
For bipartite graphs, there is
a method to color the edges that is simple and typically quite fast.
For each vertex, $u$ it maintains a set of <i>available colors</i>,
$\avail(u)$ consisting of all colors not yet assigned to any edge
incident to $u$.
These sets are initialized to $\{1,\dots,\Delta\}$.
It colors the graph by repeating the following step.
<p style="padding-left:5%">
Let $e=\{u,v\}$ be an uncolored edge. If $\avail(u)$ and $\avail(v)$ have
a color $c$ in common, let $\color(e)=c$ and proceed to the next edge. 
Otherwise, let $c_u\in avail(u)$, $c_v\in avail(v)$ and identify the
path $p$ starting at $v$ and consisting of edges with colors alternating
between $c_v$ and $c_u$. Reverse the colors of the edges on $p$ and
then let $\color(e)=c_u$. If $w$ is the last vertex of $p$,
update $\avail(w)$ to reflect the new color of the last edge on $p$.
<p>
In the example below, the recoloring operation is used recolor path
$[d,b,a,c]$ to enable edge $\{d,g\}$ to be colored green.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="70%" src="figs/recolor.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Note that because the graph is bipartite, the partial coloring is
always valid and edges on path $p$ alternate colors,
$p$ cannot contain a cycle and $w\neq u$.
To facilitate the identification of path $p$,
the algorithm maintains a mapping $emap_u(c)$ for each vertex $u$,
which maps a color $c$ to the edge incident to $u$ that has color $c$
(or undefined if there is no such edge).
<p>
In the worst case, many edges require recoloring of a path and the
paths are long. This leads to a worst-case time bound of $O(mn)$.
More typically, most edges can be colored without path recoloring,
and when it is required, the paths are fairly short.
<p>
A <i>Javascript</i> implementation of the path recoloring
algorithm appears below.

The $\color$ method of the <i>graph</i> class is just a synonymn
for the <i>weight</i>
method. This allows edge colors to be stored with the graph.

The following script can be used to demonstrate the program.

In the trace output, recolored paths are shown in square brackets,
while edges that did not require path recoloring are just listed

So in this case, three paths had to be recolored and 27 edges were
colored individually.
The fully colored graph is shown at the end.
<p>
The following script can be used to assess the performance of the algorithm.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
let n = 8000; let d = 10;
let g = randomRegularBigraph(n,d);

    `average path length=${stats["avg path length"]} ` +
    `steps=${stats.steps} ${(1000*t/g.m).toFixed(2)} us/edge`);
</pre>
Some sample output appears below.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
1000 10 recolors=1241 average path length=34 steps= 62531 0.90 us/edge 
1000 20 recolors=1826 average path length=44 steps=120786 0.80 us/edge 
1000 40 recolors=2512 average path length=51 steps=208843 0.70 us/edge

8000 10 recolors=10046 average path length=44 steps=607240 1.34 us/edge 
</pre>
Notice that the number of recoloring steps is much smaller than the
number of edges. In the first line of output for example, there are 1241
recoloring steps, while the number of edges is 10,000.
Also notice that the average path length for that case is 34, while
the largest possible path length is 999.
<p>
In the first group of results, the vertex degree scales up
(along with the number of edges) while in the second group,
the number of vertices is scaled up while keeping the degree constant.
This also scales up the number edges.
In both cases, the time spent per edge is roughly constant.
So for random regular graphs, the running time appears to be roughly $O(m)$.
<p>
It turns out that irregular random graphs rarely require any recoloring
operation (indeed, in 20 independent runs with $n=4000$ and $d=10$,
no recoloring operations were observed). This is not too surprising 
since most vertices have degree smaller than $\Delta$ meaning that they have
&ldquo;extra&rdquo; colors to choose from.
If the average degree is small (say 2), occasional recoloring operations are
observed, but they are still quite rare.
<p>
Note, that the space used by the algorithm scales in proportion to $\Delta n$,
so just initializing the data structures requires $O(\Delta n)$ time.
If $m$ and $\Delta n$ are roughly comparable (as with regular graphs),
the intialization time is $O(m)$, but if $\Delta n \gg m$
that is not the case.

<h3>Gabow's Algorithm</h3>
While the path recoloring method works well in many situations,
its worst-case performance leaves room for improvement.
Gabow developed a divide-and-conquer algorithm with a
worst-case bound that is $O(mn^{1/2}\log \Delta)$.
The algorithm is based on a recursive procedure that colors
a subgraph $H$ of $G$ with maximum vertex degree $\Delta_H$.
The steps in this procedure are described below.
<p style="padding-left:5%">
If $\Delta_H=1$ color the edges of $G$ that correspond to the edges
in $H$ using the next unused color and return.
<p style="padding-left:5%">
If $\Delta_H$ is odd, let $M$ be a matching that matches all
vertices of degree $\Delta_H$ in $H$; color the edges in $M$ using
the next unused color and remove the matching edges from $H$
(reducing $\Delta_H$ by 1).
<p style="padding-left:5%">
Divide $H$ into two subgraphs $H_1$ and $H_2$ both having maximum degree
$\Delta_H/2$. Recursively color each of these subgraphs and return.
<p>
A basic example of the procedure is shown below.
The left side of the figure shows a graph with max degree three
and a matching that matches every degree 3 vertex.
At right, the remaining edges form a graph with max degree 2,
(which happens to be a single path in this case).
So that graph splits easily into sub-graphs with max degree 1.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="60%" src="figs/gabow.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
The recursive procedure requires solutions to two sub-problems:
finding a matching that matches vertices of maximum degree and
partitioning $H$ into subgraphs for which the maxmum degree is $\Delta_H /2$.
The previous chapter includes a description of Gabow's algorithm
for maximum degree matching, which produces the matching in
$O(m_H n_H^{1/2})$ time,
where $m_H$ and $n_H$ are the number of edges and vertices in $H$.
The division into subgraphs can be done in $O(m_H)$ time.
Because the max degree is halved at each successive level of
the recursion, the number of levels is $\lceil \lg \Delta \rceil$.
Because the number of edges is halved, the time spent at each level
of the recursion is $O(mn^{1/2})$ giving an overall bound of
$O(m n^{1/2}\log \Delta)$.

<h4>Finding Euler Partitions</h4>

Gabow's algorithm divides a graph with even max degree into two
subgraphs that have half the maximum degree by first decomposing the graph
into a collection of paths and cycles (not necessarily simple),
where all the path endpoints have odd degree.
This is done by repeating the following step.

<p style="padding-left:5%">
Select a vertex $u$ of odd degree if there is one, or any vertex if
there are none of odd degree.
Construct a path (or cycle) $p$ by repeatedly selecting an edge $e=\{u,v\}$
incident to $u$, adding $e$ to $p$, removing $e$ from the graph
and replacing $u$ with $v$. This process ends when the $u$ has
no incident edges.
<p>
An example of the decomposition into paths and cycles is shown below.
Note that this graph is not bipartite and the decomposition does not
require it to be.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="90%" src="figs/euler1.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
The paths that terminate at odd-degree vertices do not have maximum degree
and the vertices of maximum degree are not endpoints of any path.
Consequently, if alternate edges of each path/cycle are assigned to
sets $E_1$ and $E_2$, the graphs defined by these subsets both have
max degree $\Delta/2$.
So in the example above, the graphs defined by sets
$\{af,hc,ab,ef,cd,gh,bd,ge\}$ and $\{fh,ca,be,dg,de,bg\}$
define the subgraphs with maximum degree 2 shown below.

Notice that rather than create multiple <i>graph</i> objects,
the implementation uses a single <i>working copy</i> of the original graph
which is modified as needed.
In particular when edges are colored they are permanently deleted
from the working copy. Also, when an Euler partition is computed,
edges are removed from the working copy and the resulting pair of edge
lists returned.
These are used later to reconstruct the two required halves of
the working copy that are needed for the recursive computation.
The edge lists are returned as arrays of equal (or nearly equal) length.
The total length of all these arrays $O(\Delta m)$.
The working copy is maintained using two methods <i>addEdge</i>
and <i>dropEdge</i> which also maintain the vertex degrees of the
vertices in the working copy. They also maintain a list of
<i>active</i> vertices, which are simply vertices with at least
one incident edge. This allows the algorithm to conveniently iterate
over the active vertices, rather than all the vertices in the working copy,
which turns out to be necessary to achieve the target time bound.
<p>
There is one last detail to take note of. Whenever a maximum degree matching
must be computed, a separate graph object is created.
This is defined on just the active vertices of the working graph,
to prevent its vertex count from significantly exceeding its edge count.

Both groups show what happens as $\Delta$ scales up,
but the first sets $\Delta$ to one less than a power of 2,
while the second group sets it to a power of 2.
The first group maximizes the number of max degree matching
computations, while the second minimizes it.
In both cases, the running times are substantially larger than
for the path recoloring method, inspite of the superior worst-case
performance of Gabow's algorithm.

<h3>Remarks</h3>
Other algorithms for bipartite edge matching have been developed over
the years that improve on the worst-case performance of Gabow's
algorithm. One example is Alon's algorithm [Alon03], which has a
worst-case time bound of $O(m \log n)$.
Alon's algorithm uses the same basic framework as Gabow's algorithm,
but replaces the maximum degree matching computation with a
different matching computation with a worst-case bound of $O(m\log n)$.
While Alon's algorithm has a better time bound, it is not clear how much
better it would be in practice.
Since on random graphs, Gabow's algorithm underperforms the
simple path recoloring method, even when no matching computations are
needed, Alon's algorithm may not provide a dramatic improvement
in practical contexts.
