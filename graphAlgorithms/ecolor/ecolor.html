<h1>Edge Coloring<sup>&copy;</sup></h1>

An <i>edge coloring</i> in an undirected graph is a function $\color$
that maps each edge to a <i>color</i>, where no vertex is incident
to more than one edge of the same color.
The objective is to color the edges using the smallest number of colors.
An example is shown below where the edge colors are shown as
positive integers.

</div>
<p>
Note that the edges assigned any specific color form a matching and
that since the maximum vertex degree in the example is 4, no coloring
can use fewer than 4 edges.
In fact, <i>Vizing's theorem</i> states that the number of colors needed
to color any graph is either $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$, where $\Delta$
is the maximum vertex degree.
Edge coloring is NP-complete for general graphs, but for
bipartite graphs, the number of colors needed is exactly $\Delta$.

<h3>Path Recoloring Method</h3>
The proof of Vizing's theorem includes a method to color the edges of the
graph, which when specialized to the bipartite case is simple and
typically quite fast.
For each vertex, $u$ it maintains a set of <i>available colors</i>,
$\avail(u)$ consisting of all colors not yet assigned to any edge
incident to $u$.
It colors the graph by repeating the following step.
<p style="padding-left:5%">
let $e=\{u,v\}$ be an uncolored edge. If $\avail(u)$ and $\avail(v)$ have
a color $c$ in common, let $\color(e)=c$ and proceed to the next edge. 
Otherwise, let $c_u\in avail(u)$, $c_v\in avail(v)$ and identify the
path $p$ starting at $v$ and consisting of edges with colors alternating
between $c_v$ and $c_u$. Reverse the colors of the edges on $p$ and
then let $\color(e)=c_u$. If the last vertex $w$ of $p$ is not $u$,
then update $\avail(w)$ to reflect the new color of the last edge on $p$.
<p>
Note that because the graph is bipartite, the partial coloring is
always valid and edges on path $p$ alternate colors,
$p$ cannot contain a cycle.
In the worst case, many edges require recoloring of a path and the
paths are long. This leads to a running time of $O(mn)$.
More typically, most edges can be colored without path recoloring,
and when it is required, the paths are fairly short.

A <i>Javascript</i> implementation of Vizing's algorithm appears below.
