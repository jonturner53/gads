<h1>Maximum Flows</h1>

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph with a distinguished
<i>source</i> vertex $s$, a distinguished <i>sink</i> vertex $t$
and a positive <i>capacity</i> for each edge $e=(u,v)$, denoted
$cap_e(u,v)$.
A <i>flow</i> on $G$ is a function that assigns a non-negative
flow value $f_e(u,v)$ to each edge.
(The subscript may be omitted for the common case of simple graphs.)
A flow function must satisfy the following two properties.
<ul>
<li> <i>capacity constraint</i>: $f(u,v) \leq cap(u,v)$.
<li> <i>flow conservation</i> for all vertices $v$ except $s$ and $t$,
    $\sum_{(u,v)\in E} f(u,v) = \sum_{(v,w) \in E} f(v,w)$.
</ul>
By convention, the flow on an edge $e=(u,v)$ is defined in both directions,
with $f_e(v,u)=-f_e(u,v)$. This is referred to as the <i>skew symmetry</i>
property. It's also convenient to define capacities in both directions,
so for $e=(u,v)$, $cap_e(v,u)=0$.
For vertices $u$ and $v$ that are not joined by an edge $f(u,v)=cap(u,v)=0$.
<p>
An example of a graph with a flow is shown below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="200" src="figs/maxflow1.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
The sum of the flows leaving $s$ is referred to as the <i>value</i>
of the flow and is denoted $|f|$.
The objective of the maximum flow problem is to find a flow function
with the largest possible value.
In principle, edge capacities may be real numbers, but in practice,
the use of floating point values to represent capacities can lead
to numerical issues. Restricting capacities and flows to integer values
eliminates this concern.

<h2>Flows and Cuts</h2>
Let $f(A,B)=\sum_{u\in A, v\in B} f(u,v)$ where $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $V$.
Similarly for $cap(A,B)$.
With this notation, the flow conservation property can be written
$f(u,V)=0$ for all $u$ except $s$ and $t$.
<p>
Define a <i>cut</i> to be a partition
of $V$ into two parts $X$ and $X'$ with $s\in X$ and $t\in X'$.
The <i>capacity</i> of the cut is $cap(X,X')$.
The <i>flow across the cut</i> is $f(X,X')$.
A cut of minimum capacity is called a <i>minimum cut</i>.
The dashed line in the diagram below defines a minimum cut.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="200" src="figs/maxflow-cut.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
The flow conservation property implies that for any cut $(X,X')$,
$f(X,X')=|f|$. To prove this, note that
$$
f(X,X') = f(X,V) - f(X,X)
$$
By skew symmetry, the second term is zero, so
$$
f(X,X') = f(X,V) = f(s,V) + f(X-s,V) = |f| + \sum_{u \in X-s} f(u,V) = |f|
$$
where the last equality follows by flow conservation.
The capacity constraint implies that for any flow $f$ and any cut $(X,X')$,
$f(X,X') \leq cap(X,X')$. This implies that the maximum flow value is
no larger than the capacity of a minimum cut.
The <i>max-flow, min-cut</i> theorem states that the maximum flow value
is equal to the minimum cut capacity.
<p>
Before verifying this, let's first
define the <i>residual capacity</i> of an edge $e=(u,v)$ as
$res_e(u,v) = cap_e(u,v) - f_e(u,v)$ and
$res_e(v,u)=f_e(u,v)$ ($=cap_e(v,u)-f_e(v,u)$).
The residual capacity gives the amount by which flow can be increased
in either the forward or reverse direction on an edge, without
violating capacity constraints.
<p>
For any vertex pair $u$ and $v$,
define a <i>flow path</i> to be any path from $u$ to $v$
consisting of edges in either orientation.
The residual capacity of a flow path from $u$ to $v$ is the minimum residual
capacity of its edges, in the $u$-to-$v$ direction.
So in the previous example, the edges $(b,a)$ and $(b,c)$
define a flow path from $a$ to $c$ with residual capacity 1,
with the first edge being traversed in the reverse direction.
An edge or flow path with a residual capacity of 0 is said to
be <i>saturated</i>.
If there is a flow path from $u$ to $v$ with positive residual capacity,
then $v$ is said to be <i>reachable</i> from $u$.
Note that if $t$ is reachable from $s$, then flow can be added to
some $s$-$t$ path. Such a path is called an <i>augmenting path</i>.
<p>
Now, suppose $f$ is a maximum flow. Let $X$ be the set of vertices
reachable from $s$ and note that $t\not\in X$, since if it were,
more flow could be added from $s$ to $t$.
Consequently $(X,X')$ defines a cut
and every edge crossing the cut must be saturated in the
direction from $X$ to $X'$. Consequently, $|f|=f(X,X')=cap(X,X')$.
Since $|f|$ is bounded by the capacity of every cut, there can be
no cut with a smaller capacity, hence $(X,X')$ is a minimum cut,
confirming the max-flow, min-cut theorem.

<h2>The Augmenting Path Method</h2>
The augmenting path method is the basis for many maximum flow algorithms.
It starts by initializing the flow on all edges to zero, then applies
the following step so long as there is an augmenting path.
<p style="padding-left:5%">
Select an augmenting path $p$ and add $res(p)$ units of flow to all
edges on $p$.
<p>
This method was first proposed by Ford and Fulkerson [FordFulk56].
If flow capacities are integers, flow increases by at least 1 on each step,
so the augmenting path algorithm terminates
in at most $|f^\ast|$ steps, where $f^\ast$ is a maximum flow.
The figure below shows a graph in which the augmenting path method
could alternate between the paths $[s,a,b,t]$ and $[s,b,a,t]$ taking
200 steps to arrive at a maximum flow.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="135" src="figs/maxflow-augpath.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Efficient algorithms can be obtained using an appropriate path
selection policy. There are two natural choices. The first is
to select augment paths of minimum length (where path length is
simply the number of edges in the path). The second is to select
paths of maximum residual capacity. Both of these algorithms
use just two steps to find a max flow in the example graph.

<h3>Shortest Augmenting Path</h3>
The shortest augmenting path version of the Ford and Fulkerson algorithm
uses breadth-first search over the edges with positive
residual capacity to find each augmenting path.
A <i>Javascript</i> implementation appears below.

As usual, the code has been abridged for clarity. The complete version includes
execution tracing and performance statistics.
Notice that the inner <code>for</code> loop of the <code>findpath</code>
function iterates over all edges incident to vertex <code>u</code>,
both incoming and outgoing.

Note that the graph is shown with the computed flow.
<p>
The time for each augmenting path step is $O(m)$.
The number of augmenting path steps can be bounded by first showing
that the lengths of the augmenting paths increase as the algorithm runs.
Let $level_i(u)$ be the length of a shortest path from $s$ to $u$
with positive residual capacity, immediately before step $i$ of the algorithm.
Note that the augmenting path selected in step $i$ must satisfy
$level_i(v)=level_i(u)+1$ for consecutive vertices $u$ and $v$ in the path.
The first step in the analysis is to prove the following lemma.
<p>
<i>Lemma 1</i>.
For all $u\in V$ and all $i > 0$, $level_{i+1}(u) \geq level_i(u)$.
<p>
<i>Proof</i>.
Suppose the claim is not true and that $k$ is the smallest integer
for which there is some vertex $v$ with $level_{i+1}(v)=k < level_{i}(v)$.
Let $e$ be an edge joining $u$ and $v$ with $res_e(u,v)>0$ following
step $i$ with $level_{i+1}(u)=k-1$ and note that $level_{i}(u)\leq k-1$.
<p>
Since $level_{i}(v) > k$, $res_e(u,v)=0$ before step $i$.
This means that step $i$ must have added flow to the edge from $v$ to $u$.
This implies that $level_{i}(v)=level_{i}(u)-1 \leq k-2$ contradicting the
original assumption that $level_{i}(v)>k$.
This argument is summarized in the diagram below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="450" src="figs/maxflow-level1.png"><br>
</div>
$\Box$
<p>
The next step is to show that $level_i(t)$ increases by at least 1 after
every $m$ steps.
<p>
<i>Lemma 2</i>.
If the number of augmenting path steps is $\geq i+m$, then
$level_{i+m}(t) > level_i(t)$.
<p>
<i>Proof</i>.
Define an augmenting path to be $i$-rising, if for every consecutive
pair of vertices on the path $u$ and $v$, $level_i(v)=level_i(u)+1$
and the path edge $e$ linking $u$ and $v$ had $res_e(u,v)>0$
immediately before step $i$.
Now, suppose that $level_i(t) = k$ and that for some $r>0$,
$level_{i+r}(t)=k$.
The lemma can be proved by showing that for $i\leq j\leq i+r$,
the augmenting path selected in step $j$ is $i$-rising.
<p>
Suppose that the path $p$ selected in step $j$
is not $i$-rising and that $j$ is the smallest
integer for which this is true.
Note that since $level_j(t)=level_i(t)$ and $p$ is $j$-rising,
every consecutive pair $u$ and $v$ on $p$ must
have $level_i(v)=level_i(u)+1$.
Since $p$ is not $i$-rising, the edge $e$ linking
some consecutive pair $u$ and $v$ on the path must have had
$res_e(u,v)=0$ just before step $i$. This means that some
augmenting step between $i$ and $j$ must have added flow from $v$ to $u$,
but since this path was $i$-rising, this implies $level_i(u)=level_i(v)+1$,
which contradicts the fact that $level_i$ values increase by 1 at all
pairs on path $p$.
<p>
Since every augmenting step saturates at least one edge and there are
at most $m$ edges joining a pair $u$ and $v$ with $level_i(v)=level_i(u)+1$,
there can be at most $m$ augmenting steps that select $i$-rising paths
of length $k$.
Consequently, $level_{i+m}(t) > level_i(t)$. $\Box$
<p>
Since augmenting paths are simple, $level_i(t) \leq n-1$,
so $level_i(t)$ can increase at most $n-2$ times.
By <i>Lemma 2</i> it must increase by at least 1 every $m$ steps, so the
number of steps is $\leq mn$ and the running time of the algorithm
is $O(m^2n)$. The example below shows how the worst-case behavior can arise.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="500" src="figs/maxflow-hardcase.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
In this example, the first nine augmenting paths have
length 11 and pass through the top left chain of vertices,
the central bipartite subgraph and the bottom right
chain of vertices. The next nine have length 15 and pass through
the bottom left chain, back, up through the central
subgraph and then through the top right chain.
Subsequent groups of paths (of length 19, 23, 27 and 31) are
similar, passing through the central subgraph in alternating
directions. As the example is scaled up, the running time scales
as $k^5$ and since $k$ is proportional to $n$, this is $\Omega(n^5)$.
<h3> Maximum Capacity Augmentation</h3>
In principle, the  number of augmenting steps used by the
Ford and Fulkerson method can can be as little as $m$,
as shown in the following lemma.
<p>
<i>Lemma 3</i>. There is a sequence of $\leq m$ augmenting path steps
that leads to a maximum flow.
<p>
<i>Proof</i>. Given a maximum flow on $G$, remove all edges with zero flow.
Let $p$ be a path from $t$ to $s$ with positive residual capacity, $\delta$.
Push $\delta$ units of flow along $p$ and remove all edges that now have
zero flow. This must remove at least one edge, so repeating this process,
all edges will have been deleted in at most $m$ steps. The selected paths
can all be reversed, making them augmenting paths in $G$. $\Box$
<p>
<i>Lemma 3</i> can be used to bound the number of steps used by
the version of the
augmenting path method that selects maximum residual capacity paths.
<p>
Define $remainder_i$ to be the difference between the maximum
flow value and the current flow value, just before step $i$.
From the argument used in the proof of <i>Lemma 3</i>, there is a sequence
of at most $m$ augmenting steps leading to a maximum flow. Therefore,
the maximum capacity path must have capacity at least $remainder_i/m$.
If the total number of augmenting path steps is greater than $i+2m$,
then at least one of the next $2m$ steps must add less than
$remainder_i/2m$ units of flow.
This means that after $2m$ steps, the capacity of the maximum capacity path
is reduced by at least a factor of 2.
If the maximum edge capacity is $C$, the number of augmenting path steps
is $O(m\log C)$ and if $C$ is poloynomial in $n$, this is $O(m\log n)$.
<p>
One can use a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to find paths with
maximum residual capacity. As with Dijkstra's algorithm, a heap is used
to keep track of vertices at the border of a tree whose paths
are all maximum capacity paths. A border vertex $u$ is stored in the
heap using a key matching the residual capacity of the best edge 
examined so far from a tree vertex to $u$.
A <i>Javascript</i> implementation of the <code>findpath</code>
function used by the maximum capacity augmenting
path algorithm is shown below.

The running time for the max capacity algorithm is
$O(m^2(\log_{2+m/n} n)(\log C))$.
For dense graphs, this is $O(m^2(\log C))$ and

<h2>Capacity Scaling</h2>
The capacity scaling algorithm is a variant on the maximum capacity
algorithm, which has $O(m^2\log C)$ execution time at all graph densities.
This provides a theoretical advantage, but not necessarily one that
holds up in practice.
The key idea is to first select shortest augmenting paths from
among those that have residual capacity exceeding some scaling
threshold. When there are no new paths with large enough capacity,
the scaling threshold is halved.
A <i>Javascript</i> implementation appears below.

Note how the <code>findpath</code> method uses breadth-first search
over the edges with residual capacity larger than the <code>scale</code>
threshold. If it fails to find a path at the current scale value,
it halves the value and tries again.
Running <code>maxflowFFcs</code> in place of <code>maxflowFFmc</code>
in the web app produces the same output as for the maximum capacity
algorithm. In general, the scaling algorithm may use more augmenting
steps, although the number remains $O(m\log C)$.

hardTest(maxflowFFsp, 'FFsp', g, k1, k2);
</pre>
The function <code>maxflowHardcase</code> produces graphs that are
similar to the example given above. Indeed, if <code>k1=k2=3</code>,
it produces exactly the graph shown in the example.
The two parameters allow one to separately control the number
of distinct path lengths (<code>k1</code>) and the size of the
central subgraph (<code>k2</code>).
The results below show the effect of increasing <code>k1</code> from
10 to 80, while holding <code>k2</code> fixed.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
FFsp k1=10 k2=10 317ms paths=2000 steps/path=576

FFsp k1=80 k2=10 12340ms paths=16000 steps/path=2607
</pre>
Note that the number of augmenting paths grows directly with <code>k1</code>,
and as the paths get longer, so does the average number of steps per path. 
Consequently, the running time grows quadratically.
The results below show the effect of increasing <code>k2</code> from
10 to 80, while holding <code>k1</code> fixed.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
FFsp k1=10 k2=10 310ms paths=2000 steps/path=576

FFsp k1=10 k2=80 341067ms paths=128000 steps/path=13733
</pre>
In this case, the number of augmenting paths grows quadratically with
<code>k2</code> as does the number of steps per path.
Consequently, the run time grows as the fourth power of <code>k2</code>.
<p>
While these graphs are not really worst case for the max capacity and
capacity scaling algorithms, it's still interesting to see how they
behave.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">

</pre>
For the max capacity algorithm, the number of paths grows
directly with both parameters. Note that all the paths bypass the
central bipartite graph, leading to a much smaller number of path
searches.
The average number of steps per path search also grows directly
with both parameters, consequently the run time grows quadratically
in both cases.

</pre>
For capacity scaling, the number of steps per path
grows directly with <code>k1</code> but the number
of paths per step grows quadratically with <code>k2</code>,
as most path searches must examine the edges in the central
subgraph to detemine that their residual capacity falls below
the scale threshold. The use of the heap in the max capacity
algorithm allows it to avoid examining most of these edges.
<p>
To compare the performance of the various augmenting path
algorithms on random graphs, enter the following code in the web app.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
function randomTest(algo, label, g, d) {
    g.clearFlow();
    let t0 = Date.now(); let [,,stats] = algo(g); let t1 = Date.now();
    let fstats = g.flowStats(); 
 
    log(`${label} n=${g.n} d=${d} cutSize=${fstats.cutSize} ${t1-t0}ms ` +
        `paths=${stats.findpathCount} ` +
        `steps/path=${~~(stats.findpathSteps/stats.findpathCount)}`);
}

let n=402; let d=50; 
let g = randomFlograph(n, d); 
g.randomCapacities(randomInteger, 1, 99);

randomTest(maxflowFFsp, 'FFsp', g, d);
randomTest(maxflowFFmc, 'FFmc', g, d);
randomTest(maxflowFFcs, 'FFcs', g, d);
</pre>
The <code>randomFlograph()</code> function produces a graph on $n$ vertices
with average out-degree $d$ and a built-in &ldquo;small cut&rdquo;.
In this case, that small cut contains 126 edges and splits the vertex
set in half. (This function can also be used to generate graphs with multiple
small cuts.)
Running the code produces the output shown below.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
FFsp n=202 d=25 cutSize=126 220ms paths=301 steps/path=8523 
FFmc n=202 d=25 cutSize=126 186ms paths=140 steps/path=6171 
FFcs n=202 d=25 cutSize=126 169ms paths=181 steps/path=7597 
</pre>
The shortest path variant requires more path
searches, as expected, and requires a larger number of steps per path.
Still, the slowest only requires about 30% more time that the fastest.
Doubling the number of vertices produces the following results.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
FFsp n=402 d=25 cutSize=138 597ms paths=383 steps/path=18020 
FFmc n=402 d=25 cutSize=138 666ms paths=162 steps/path=15583 
FFcs n=402 d=25 cutSize=138 469ms paths=224 steps/path=15502 
</pre>
The max capacity variant turns out to be the slowest in this case,
which is a little surprising, since the number of paths is less
than half the number used by the shortest path variant.
Doubling the average vertex degree (and hence the number of edges)
produces the results below.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
FFsp n=402 d=50 cutSize=500 3776ms paths=1200 steps/path=34871 
FFmc n=402 d=50 cutSize=500 2054ms paths=558 steps/path=16678 
FFcs n=402 d=50 cutSize=500 3304ms paths=784 steps/path=30611 
</pre>
Notice the large increase in the size of the small cut in this case.
This contributes to an increase in the number of path searches by
all three algorithms. The number of steps per path also goes up
for all three, although the increase for the max capacity variant
is less than 10 percent.

<h2>Dinic's Algorithm</h2>
Dinic's algorithm is essentially a more efficient implementation
of the shortest path variant of the Ford and Fulkerson algorithm.
It explicitly divides the execution into distinct phases,
where the augmenting paths selected in each phase all have the same length.
This enables a more efficient path-finding procedure.
<p>
At the start of each phase, Dinic's algorithm computes
a function $level(u)$, which is the length of a shortest
path with positive residual capacity from $s$ to $u$.
During the phase, path searches are restricted to edges $e$
joining vertices $u$ and $v$ with $res_e(u,v)>0$
and $level(v) = level(u)+1$ and $level(u)< level(t)$.
<p>
The resulting &ldquo;searchable subgraph&rdquo; can be viewed
as a directed acyclic graph. Path searches are done using
depth-first search in this graph, with paths leading to
dead-ends being effectively &ldquo;pruned&rdquo;, making later searches
more efficient. A <i>Javascript</i> implementation of Dinic's
algorithm appears below.

}
</textarea> <p>
The <code>findpath</code> function uses depth-first search,
returning true whenever it finds an augmenting path and false, otherwise.
Note that <code>nextedge[u]</code> specifies the next edge to be processed at
<code>u</code> within a phase. It is intialized to the
first vertex on <code>u</code>'s adjacency list at the start of the
phase and is advanced
to the next vertex on the list whenever the search determines that
the current <code>nextedge</code> value leads to a deadend.
<p>
From the earlier analysis of the shortest augmenting path algorithm,
the value of $level(t)$ increase with each phase of Dinic's algorithm,
which means the number of phases is $<n$.
The computation of $level$ at the start of each phase takes $O(m)$ time
and the number of path searches per phase is at most $m$. To determine
the number of steps required for the path searches, let $N_i$ be
the number of edges examined by the $i$-th top-level call to
<code>findpath</code> and note that the time required for all calls to
<code>findpath</code> is $O(\sum N_i)$. The <code>nextedge</code> pointer
is advanced to the next edge for every edge examined that is not part of
the path returned by <code>findpath</code>. Since the path length is
at most $n$, pointers are advanced at least $N_i-n$ times during the
$i$-th call to <code>findpath</code>. But during the phase, the
<code>nextedge</code> pointers can be advanced at most $2m$ time,
so $\sum_{1\leq i\leq m} (N_i-n) \leq 2m$ and $\sum N_i = O(mn)$. 
Thus, the overall running time is $O(mn^2)$
<p>
The worst-case example shown earlier for the shortest augmenting path
algorithm is also a worst-case for Dinic's algorithm. It does end up
being substantially faster on this example because it avoids re-examining
the entire central subgraph on each path search.
Note that it does still trace the long chains of vertices leading
to and from the central subgraph on each path search.
The time spent following those chains can be significantly reduced
using the <i>dynamic trees</i> data structure of Sleator and Tarjan.

<h3>Using Dynamic Trees to Represent Unsaturated Paths</h3>
The dynamic trees data structure can be used to speed up
augmenting path searches, by storing information about previously
explored paths with positive residual capacity.
Each vertex $u$ with parent $v$ in the dynamic trees data
structure is associated with an edge $e$ joining $u$ and $v$ in the
flow graph with $res_e(u,v)>0$ and $level(v)=level(u)+1$.
The cost of $u$ in the dynamic trees
data structure is set to $res_e(u,v)>0$, while the cost of every root
vertex is set to a value large enough so that the root is never the
minimum cost node on a tree path.
Consequently, the path from $u$ to its tree root corresponds to
an unsaturated path in the flow graph and the residual capacity of
this path is the minimum cost of the tree path.
For flow graph edges that are not associated
with a tree edge, flow information is maintained in the flow graph.
<p>
The figure illustrates the use of dynamic trees.
It two trees overlaid on the edges of a flow graph joining vertices
$u$ and $v$ for which $level(v)=level(u)+1$.
Note that the minimum cost on the
tree path from $a$ to $i$ is 3, implying that the residual
capacity of the path in the flow graph is also 3.
Subtracting 3 from the cost of this tree path effectively adds 3 units of
flow to all the edges on the path in the flow graph.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="450" src="figs/maxflowDtrees.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
<p>
The <code>findpath</code> function uses the dynamic trees data structure
to take shortcuts through the flow graph, linking trees together until
there is a tree path from the source to the sink. When deadends are
discovered, they are pruned from the tree.
Because the average time per operation in a sequence of dynamic tree
operations is $O(\log n)$, this reduces the worst-case time for each
phase of the algorithm by a factor proportional to $n/\log n$.

The first of the two inner loops in the <code>findpath</code>
method combines trees in the dynamic trees data structure
in order to create a tree path from the source to the sink.
The <code>extend</code> method makes the required changes to
the tree and sets the cost to reflect the residual capacity.
If it fails to extend the tree containing the source vertex
at some point, the loop terminates and the second of the two
inner loops is executed. This loop prunes the dead end encountered
in the first loop, using. This involves removing all the tree
edges entering the dead end vertex and updating the cost of the
flow graph. The <code>prune</code> method handles the details of this.
<p>
During one phase, <code>prune</code> is called at most $m$ times.
To see this, note that whenever it is called from <code>findpath</code>
or <code>augment</code>, one of the <code>nextEdge</code> pointers is
advanced. The number of calls to <code>extend</code> is also at most
$m$ since no edge is added the dynamic trees data structure more than once.
This means that there are $O(m)$ operations performed onthe dynamic trees
data structure during a phase and that the running time contributed by
these operations is $O(m\log n)$, and the overall runnning time
is $O(mn\log n)$.

Dinic's algorithm is dramatically faster because it uses
far fewer steps per path.
As the graphs get larger, the version using dynamic trees
performs much better than the standard version because it
does not have to follow the long vertex chains repeatedly.

trees is actually slower than the standard version.
This can be explained by the shorter augmenting path lengths in the
random graphs and the much more limited opportunity to exploit shortcuts.
Indeed, the contrast between the random and hard test cases makes it
clear that the dynamic trees data structure is really only likely to be
advantageous in artificial situations where long path segments show up
in large numbers of augmenting paths. It's unlikely that this will happen
much in practice, making the practical benefit of dynamic trees
somewhat questionable.
On the other hand, it is never dramatically slower than the simpler
version, and it is occasionally dramatically faster.

<h2>The Preflow-Push Method</h2>
The <i>preflow-push</i> (also know as push-relabel) method
of Goldman and Tarjan [GTXX]
for computing maximum flows takes a distinctly different approach.
Instead of incrementally improving a flow function, approaching the
maximum flow value &ldquo;from below&rdquo;,
it starts with a <i>preflow</i> with
value exceeding the maximum flow, and transforms it into a flow,
approaching the maximum flow value &ldquo;from above&rdquo;.
Like a flow function, a preflow assigns a flow to every edge while
respecting the capacity limits, but unlike a flow, it may violate
the flow conservation condition.
In particular, it allows the total flow entering a vertex to exceed
the flow leaving the vertex, resulting in an <i>excess flow</i> at that
vertex. The excess flow at a vertex $u$ is denoted $\Delta(u)$
and any non-source/sink vertex with $\Delta(u)>0$ is said
to be <i>unbalanced</i>.
<p>
The basic idea behind the preflow-push method can be sketched as follows.
First, add flow to all edges leaving the source, saturating them.
Then, as long as there is an unbalanced vertex, repeat the following step.
<p style="padding-left:5%">
Select an unbalanced vertex $u$; if $u$ has an <i>admissible edge</i>
$e=(u,v)$, add $\min\{res_e(u,v), \Delta(u)\}$
units of flow from $u$ to $v$; otherwise, expand the set
of admissible edges at $u$.
<p>
So, the preflow-push method attempts to balance vertices by pushing flow
out on its admissible edges.
It uses a technique that is similar to the use of
the <i>level</i> function in Dinic's algorithm, to determine which edges
are admissible.
Each vertex $u$ is assigned a <i>distance label</i> $d(u)$ and
an edge $e=(u,v)$ is defined to be admissible at $u$
if $res_e(u,v)>0$ and $d(u)=d(v)+1$.
The distance labels are said to be <i>valid</i> if $d(s)=n$,
$d(t)=0$ and $d(u)\leq d(v)+1$ for every edge $e=(u,v)$ with $res_e(u,v)>0$.
Distance labels are said to be <i>exact</i> if $d(u)= d(v)+1$
for every edge with $res_e(u,v)>0$.
<p>
With these definitions, the general preflow-push method can be stated
as follows.
Saturate all edges leaving the source and initialize the distance labels
by setting $d(s)=n$ and $d(u)$ to the length of the shortest
non-saturated path from $u$ to the sink, for all other vertices.
Then, repeat the following step, so long as there is an unbalanced vertex.
<p style="padding-left:5%">
Select an unbalanced vertex $u$; if $u$ has an <i>admissible edge</i>
$e=(u,v)$, add $\min\{res_e(u,v), \Delta(u)\}$ units of flow from $u$ to $v$;
otherwise, let $d(u)=\min_{e=(u,v)} d(v)+1$ where the minimum is over all
edges with $res_e(u,v)>0$.
<p>
Note that each step preserves the validity of the distance labels.
Also, note that following initialization, there is a saturated cut separating
the source from the sink. This remains true at every step.
To understand why, note that if a saturated cut exists before a step 
at vertex $u$ but not after the step, the step must add flow to an
edge $e=(u,v)$ and this edge must be in such a cut. Also, adding flow
to the edge must create an augmenting path and that path must pass
from vertex $v$ through edge $e$ to $u$. However, since the step adds
flow from $u$ to $v$, there must be a non-saturated path from $v$ to $t$
before the step and this implies that there was also an augmenting path
from $s$ to $t$ before the step.
Since there is still a saturated cut when the method terminates, 
the flow at that point must be a maximum flow.
<p>
The figure below shows a flow graph just after the preflow-push
initialization. The excess flow at each vertex is shown above the
vertex, while the distance label is shown below it.
The admissible edges are highlighted in bold.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="350" src="figs/preflowpushExample1.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
The figure below shows the state of the flow graph after $b$ is selected
two times. In this case, the bold highlighting is used to emphasize
what has changed.
Note that at this point, the edge $(b,e)$ is admissible at $b$.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="350" src="figs/preflowpushExample2.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
The next figure shows the state after $c$ is selected three times.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="350" src="figs/preflowpushExample3.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
The next step shows the state after $b$ is selected once followed by $f$.
Note that both vertices are now balanced.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="350" src="figs/preflowpushExample4.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Continuing in this fashion, eventually leads to a situation where
all vertices are balanced. Note that the basic version of the preflow-push
method does not specify which vertex to select at each step.
Specific selection methods can make the method more efficient.
Still, it's worthwhile analyzing the performance of the general method,
since portions of the analysis carry over to the more efficient variants.
<p>
First, note that every unbalanced vertex $u$ has a non-saturated path
back to the source throughout the execution of the method. This follows easily
by induction on the number of steps.
Next, note that whenever a vertex $u$ is relabeled, it is unbalanced,
and so the existence of a non-saturated path plus the validity of the
distance labels implies that $d(u) <2n$.
This implies that the each vertex is relabled $<2n$ times,
since each step increases the label by at least 1.
The time required to relabel a vertex is bounded by the number
of edges incident it, so the total time
spent relabeling all vertices is $O(mn)$.
<p>
Note that as long as the label of a vertex does not change,
none of its non-admissible edges can become admissible.
This means that once an edge at $u$ has been checked
for admissibility, it need not be checked again until $u$ is relabeled.
If $nextedge(u)$ is initialized to the first edge in $u$'s adjacency
list whenever $u$ is relabeled and is advanced to the next edge in
the adjacency list whenever an inadmissible edge is found,
all edges at $u$ can be checked for admissibility in a single pass
through the adjacency list for each relabeling of $u$.
Since each vertex is relabeled $<2n$ times, the total time
spent searching for admissible edges is $O(mn)$.
<p>
Since any step that saturates an edge $e=(u,v)$ makes $e$ inadmissible
at $u$ and because fewer than $2n$ steps make any edge admissible at $u$,
the time spent on steps that saturate an edge at $u$ is $O(mn)$.
<p>
What remains is to determine the time spent on steps that add flow to
an edge but do not saturate it.
The following lemma bounds the number of these steps.
<p>
<i>Lemma 4</i>. The number of steps that add flow and do not saturate
an edges is $O(mn^2)$.
<p>
<i>Proof</i>. The total number of steps taken be the algorithm
can be bounded using an amortized complexity analysis
that implements the following credit policy.
<p style="padding-left:5%">
The number of credits on hand is always at least equal to the
sum of the distance labels at the unbalanced vertices.
<p>
The policy can be satisfied at the start of execution using fewer
than $2n^2$ credits and each step may require additional credits to
satisfy the credit policy and account for the step. There are three cases.
<ul>
<li>
<i>Steps that adds flow to an edge $e=(u,v)$ without saturating it.</i>
Each such step makes $u$ balanced and may make
$v$ unbalanced, but in any case the number of credits needed to
satisfy the credit policy drops by at least one and this credit can be used to
account for the step.
<li>
<i>Steps that relabel a vertex $u$</i>.
Such steps increase the number of credits needed to satisfy the credit policy,
but since the total increase from all such steps is $<2n^2$, the number of
credits needed to satisfy the credit policy and account 
for all such steps is $O(n^2)$.
<li>
<i>Steps that saturate an edge $e=(u,v)$</i>. Because these steps make $v$
unbalanced, they may require $d(v)$ new credits to satisfy the credit
policy. Since there are $O(mn)$ steps that saturate an edge and $d(v)<2n$,
the total number of credits needed to maintain the credit policy for these
steps is $O(mn^2)$.
</ul>
Since each step is accounted for with an allocated credit and the total
number of allocated credits is $O(mn^2)$, the total number of steps is
$O(mn^2)$. $\Box$
<p>
Because each step that adds flow to an edge without saturating
it takes constant time (excluding the time spent identifying admissible edges),
the time spent on these steps is $O(mn^2)$ as is the overall runnning time
of the algorithm. Thus, the general preflow-push method has the same
worst-case performance as Dinic's algorithm.
<p>
The preflow-push does have one drawback that any actual implementation
needs to address in order to get good performance in practice.
Specifically, it can spend a lot of time pushing excess flow out
back out of portions of the graph with no remaining unsaturated paths
to the sink. A simple example of this is shown below.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="500" src="figs/prepushDeadend1.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Note that $e$ is unbalanced, so if $e$ is selected next, it will be
relabeled, allowing flow to be pushed back to $d$ on the next step.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="500" src="figs/prepushDeadend2.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
At this point, $d$ is unbalanced and if it is selected next, it will
be relabeled allowing flow to be pushed forward to $e$ again.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="500" src="figs/prepushDeadend3.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Since $e$ is now unbalanced, it can be relabeled and flow
pushed back to $d$ and $c$ in the next two steps.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="500" src="figs/prepushDeadend4.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
At this point $c$ is relabeled, allowing flow to move forward again
to $d$, which is then relabeled and sends flow forwward to $e$.
This pattern of back and forth flow adjustments continues until
the labels at vertices $b$ through $e$ increase to 9, 10, 11 and 12.
For longer paths, the number of steps grows quadratically with
the path length.
Clearly, there is a lot of wasted effort here.
The source of this inefficiency is the incremental adjustment of
distance labels.
<p>
It's instructive to compare the incremental adjustment of vertex labels
to the periodic recomputation of the level function in Dinic's algorithm.
That approach can also be incorporated into the preflow-push method.
Specifically, the relabelling can be deferred until 
all unbalanced vertices are processed.
At that point, if there are still unbalanced vertices,
exact vertex labels are computed for all vertices.
This &ldquo;batch relabel&rdquo; approach is usually significantly faster
than incremental relabeling, although they both share the
same worst-case performance.
It turns out that an intermediate approach that alternates between
incremental relabeling and batch relabeling can be even more efficient.
There are several strategies one can use to implement such an approach.
One such strategy is used in the <i>Javascript</i> implementation
described in the next section.

<h3>FIFO Selection Method</h3>
The FIFO selection policy keeps the unbalanced vertices in a queue,
adding vertices to the end of the queue when they become
unbalanced or relabeled.
Vertices are selected for processing from the front of the queue,
and the currently selected vertex is retained until it is either
balanced or relabeled.
<p>
The performance of the FIFO variant can be
analyzed by dividing the execution into phases. A phase ends when all
vertices on the queue at the start of the phase have been selected.
Each phase contains at most $n$ steps that add flow to an edge without
saturating it (since each such step balances a vertex), so if the number
of phases is $O(n^2)$, the overall running time is $O(n^3)$.
<p>
Since the number of steps that relabel a vertex is $<2n^2$,
the number of phases that include at least one such step is also $<2n^2$.
An amortized analysis can be used to bound the number of phases
that do not include a step that relabels a vertex.
The required credit policy is stated below.
<p style="padding-left:5%">
The number of credits on hand is never less than the largest label
at an unbalanced vertex.
<p>
The policy can be satisfied initially using $<2n$ credits.
In every phase in which no vertex is relabeled, every vertex that
was unbalanced at the start of the phase becomes balanced.
Since each step pushes flow to vertices with smaller labels,
The largest label at an unbalanced vertex must decrease by at least 1
during such a phase,
reducing the number of credits needed to satisfy the credit policy
and providing a credit that can be used to account for the phase.
<p>
The phases that do relabel vertices may increase the number of
required credits, since each increase in a label has the potential to
increase the maximum label. Since the total increase in the labels over
the course of the algorithm is $<2n^2$,
the number of credits that must be allocated for these phases is $O(n^2)$.
Consequently, the total number of credits allocated is $O(n^2)$
and the number of phases in which no vertex is relabeled is also $O(n^2)$.
<p>
The <i>Javascript</i> implementation of the preflow-push method is
divided into parts. There is a core module that implements the
portion of the algorithm that is common to all variants, and for each
variant, there is another module
that handles the processing that is specific to that variant.
The module for the FIFO variant appears below.

The <code>balance()</code> attempts to balance flow at a vertex
by pushing flow out on its admissible edges.
It returns when it has balanced the vertex or examined
all of its admissible edges.
<p>
Observe that when the program is operating in batch mode,
it simply attempts to balance all the unbalanced vertices,
without doing any incremental relabeling operations.
When not in batch mode, each unsuccessful balance attempt
causes a vertex to be relabeled.
<p>
The optional parameter <code>relabThresh</code> determines when the
program switches from incremental relabeling to batch relabeling.
The <code>relabelSteps</code> counter is incremented for each edge
examined by the <code>minlabel</code> method.
Whenever batch relabeling is performed, incremental relabeling is
enabled until the number of additional computational steps performed
by the incremental relabeling code exceeds <code>relabThresh</code>.
At that point, the program switches to batch mode, suspending
incremental relabeling until all unbalanced vertices have been processed
and another batch relabeling has been performed.
Note that the default value for <code>relabThresh</code> is <code>g.m</code>.
This choice ensures that the total amount of computation done for
incremental relabeling roughly matches that for batch relabeling method.
<p>
The following code fragment can be used to demonstrate the FIFO method.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
let g = new Flograph();
g.fromString('{a->[b:5 d:6] b[c:3 d:7 g:3] c[d:1 e:5] d[e:2 f:1 g:3] ' +

let [f,ts] = maxflowGTf(g,1);
log(ts, '\n' + g.toString(0,1));

Running this produces the output shown below.
The output shows each selected unbalanced vertex,

on which flow was pushed during the balancing operation.
A single asterisk at the end of a line indicates that an

was done. The final flow is shown at the end.

<h3>Highest Label First Selection Method</h3>
The highest label first selection method
pushes flow from vertices with large label values before moving on
to those with smaller labels. This reduces the number of balance
operations that are required and leads to an overall running time
that is $O(m^{1/2} n^2)$.
This method is implemented by dividing the unbalanced vertices into
lists of vertices with the same label, then storing the head of
each list in an array, at the position specified by its label.

method appears below.

</textarea> <p>
Observe that a singe call to the <code>getUnbal</code> function
can require up to $2n$ iterations of the while loop.
However, the total number of iterations over all calls can be bounded by
the total increase in the distance labels. This implies that the
total time spent in the while loop is $O(n^2)$.
<p>
The trace output from <code>maxflowGThl</code>
when run on the sample graph from the last section
is shown below.

The first line below shows the results the pure batch relabeling approach,
the last line shows the pure incrmental relabeling approach and the
middle line shows the mixed approach using the default value of
<code>relabThresh</code>.
Note that each batch relabeling operation contributes $2m$ relabeling steps.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
f n=202 d=25  11ms relabCount=   7 relabSteps= 70350 balCount=  702 balSteps= 27110  
f n=202 d=25   7ms relabCount= 187 relabSteps= 41401 balCount=  801 balSteps= 29069  
f n=202 d=25 102ms relabCount=8261 relabSteps=523532 balCount=12018 balSteps=515617
</pre>
The the number of relabel steps and balance steps is much higher for
the incremental relabeling approach, due to the large number of largely
unproductive incremental relabeling steps that occur towards the end
of execution, as flow is pushed back towards the source.
Because each batch relabeling operation is relatively expensive,
a mixed approach works better than a pure batch approach.
Even a fairly small value of <code>relabeThresh</code> yields
some improvement, but the default value effectively balances the
computation from incremental relabeling steps with those from
batch relabeling steps.
<p>
The results below compare the FIFO and highest-label-first approaches
for three different random graphs.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
f  n=202 d=25  7ms relabCount=177 relabSteps= 40924 balCount= 758 balSteps= 29604

f  n=402 d=25 15ms relabCount=379 relabSteps= 83037 balCount=1425 balSteps= 54660  
hl n=402 d=25 21ms relabCount=533 relabSteps=112885 balCount=1982 balSteps= 66555

</pre>
The FIFO method out-performs the highest label first method and this
pattern generally holds up for larger and more sparse random graphs as well.
However, the highest label method can perform better for the worst-case
graphs for Dinic's algorithm.
In this case, it does fewer balance operations and fewer steps per operation.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
f   20 20 10ms relabCount=2245 relabSteps=25573 balCount=9094 balSteps=18594  
hl  20 20  9ms relabCount=2237 relabSteps=25568 balCount=7276 balSteps=16165  
</pre>
In this case, it does fewer balance operations and fewer steps per operation.
Both perform much better than either version of Dinic's algorithm,
as can be seen from the earlier results reproduced below.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
D    k1=20 k2=20 345ms paths=16000 steps/path=92
DST  k1=20 k2=20  65ms paths=16000 steps/path=37
</pre>
For random graphs, the advantage over Dinic's algorithm is smaller,
but still significant.

<h2>Minimum Flow Requirements</h2>
In some applications, it's useful to be able to specify a minimum flow
requirement or <i>flow floor</i> for some or all edges.
Since not all sets of floors can be satisfied, the 
first step is to determine if there is a feasible flow that is
compatible with the specified floors.
This can be done by first making an ordinary flow graph with
the same edges as the original, but no floors.
Each edge's capacity is set to the difference between the
original edge's capacity and its floor.
<p>
Next, a high capacity edge is added from the sink to the source.
Then a new source, $s'$ is added, along with a new sink, $t'$.
Now, for each original edge $e=(u,v)$ with a floor of $f$,
edges $(s',v)$ and $(u,t')$ with capacity $f$ are
added to the graph, and a maximum flow is computed.
If the maximum flow does not saturate all edges from $s'$, 
there is no flow that is compatible with the specified floors.
<p>
If the computed flow does saturate all edges from $s'$,
each edge flow in the original graph is set to equal the
computed flow for that edge plus its floor value.
This is a feasible flow on the original graph for the specified floors.
The feasible flow can be extended to a maximum flow, using a slightly
modified definition of the residual capacity. Specifically, for
an edge $e=(u,v)$, $res_e(v,u)=f_e(u,v) - floor(e)$. 
This change prevents the max flow algorithm from reducing the flow on
an edge below its floor value.
<p>
The <code>Flograph</code> data structure can be extended to support flow floors
using the method <code>addFloors()</code> or by setting a flow value using
<code>setFloor()</code>. In a graph that has not been extended to support floors,
the method <code>floor(e)</code> returns 0 for all edges.
The <i>Javascript</i> function <code>flowfloor()</code> shown below,
attempts to find a feasible flow for a flow graph with specified floor values.

          style="font-size: 95%;background-color:lightCyan">
export default function flowfloor(g) {
    // First determine total capacity, number
    // of edges with non-zero floors and the sum of min flows

    for (let e = g.first(); e != 0; e = g.next(e)) {
        totalCap += g.cap(g.tail(e),e);
        totalFloor += g.floor(e);

    let g1 = new Flograph(g.n+2, g.m+2*floorCount+1);
    g1.setSource(g.n+1); g1.setSink(g.n+2);
    for (let e = g.first(); e != 0; e = g.next(e)) {
        g1.join(g.tail(e), g.head(e), e);
        g1.setCapacity(e,g.cap(e) - g.floor(e));
    }

        g1.setCapacity(g1.join(g1.tail(e), g1.sink), g.floor(e));
    }
    // Finally, add high capacity edge from original sink to original source
    let e = g1.join(g.sink, g.source); g1.setCapacity(e, totalCap);

    // Now, find max flow in g1 and check that floor values are all satisfied
    let [f, ts, stats] = maxflowD(g1);

    // Now transfer computed flows back into g
    for (let e = g.first(); e != 0; e = g.next(e))
        g.setFlow(e, g1.f(e) + g.floor(e));
    return g.totalFlow();
}
</textarea> <p>
Note that any max flow algorithm can be used to find the maximum flow in
<code>g1</code>. Dinic's algorithm was chosen here, as it makes
the trace output easier to follow.
The following code can be used to demonstrate the program.
<pre style="padding-left:5%">
let g = new Flograph();
g.fromString('{a->[b:3 d:2] b[c:3 d:2-7 g:3] c[d:1 e:5] d[e:2 f:1 g:3] ' +
             'e[f:1 g:3 h:1-4] f[e:1 g:2 h:3] g[e:3 f:2-7 h:1] ' +
             'h[f:3 i:4 j:2] i[g:2-5 j:6] ->j[]}');
let [f, ts] = flowfloor(g, true);
log((f < 0 ? 'no ' : '') + 'feasible flow');
log(ts + '\n' +  g.toString(0,1));
</pre>
This produces the output shown below.
