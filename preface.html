<h1>Graph Algorithms and Data Structures<cup>&copy;</sup></h1>
<p>
This web site is intended to serve as an online reference book
for interesting graph algorithms and data structures.
It includes tutorial material explaining the various algorithms
as well as real implementations that you can use to see in detail
exactly how the algorithms work. It also includes a web application that you
can use to run the algorithms in your browser with text output displayed
in a browser window.
<p>
The book is loosely based on a course that I taught at Washington University
for many years. That course was originally built around a beautiful book
by Robert Tarjan,
<i>Data Structures and Network Algorithms</i>, which is a sterling
example of lucid and concise technical writing. It is quite short
(132 pages), but packed with information and insight.
I used to tell my students that Tarjan tells you everything that's
necessary, but not one word more. Careful reading and close attention to
detail is often needed to fully understand what he is
saying, but it's well worth the effort.
Sadly, the book is now out of print, but pdf versions are available online.
Tarjan's influence can be found throughout this site, but the presentation
is more tutorial, has an expanded range of topics and takes advantage
of the online context to provide live examples.
<p>
The outline below shows the overall plan for the book.
The chapters shown in gray are still to come.
As I am retired now, this is frankly a hobby project that
I am pursuing largely for my own interest. However, I certainly
hope others find it useful and am happy to receive feedback on
how I might make it more useful. You can reach me at jon.turner@wustl.edu.

Note that the chapters have been organized for convenient reference,
but it is not recommended that you read them in order,
as the data structures chapters can be a little dry when unconnected
to specific algorithms. A good approach is to start with the
algorithms chapters and whenever you encounter a new data structure,
refer back to the appropriate chapters.
You also may want to read the algorithms chapters in two passes,
first reading about one or two algorithms for a given problem
before coming back later
to learn about the more advanced ones.
