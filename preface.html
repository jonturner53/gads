<h1>Graph Algorithms and Data Structures</h1>
<p>
This web site is intended as an online reference for interesting
graph algorithms and data structures.
It includes tutorial material explaining the various algorithms
as well as real implementations that you can use to see in detail
exactly how they work. It also includes a web application that you
can use to run the algorithms in your browser with text output displayed
in a browser window.
<p>
The site is loosely based on a course that I taught at Washington University
for many years. That course was originally built around a beautiful book
by Robert Tarjan,
<i>Data Structures and Network Algorithms</i>, which is a sterling
example of lucid and concise technical writing. It is quite short
(132 pages), but packed with information and insight.
I used to tell my students that Tarjan tells you everything that's
necessary, but not one word more. Careful reading and close attention to
detail is often needed to fully understand what he is
saying, but it's well worth the effort.
Sadly, the book is now out of print, but pdf versions can be found online.
Tarjan's influence can be found throughout this site, but the presentation
is more tutorial, has an expanded range of topics and takes advantage
of the online context to provide live examples.
<p>
The outline below shows the overall plan for the site.
Those shown in gray are still to come.
As I am retired now, this is frankly a hobby project that
I am pursuing largely for my own interest. However, I certainly
hope others find it useful and am happy to receive feedback on
how I might make it more useful. You can reach me at jon.turner@wustl.edu.
