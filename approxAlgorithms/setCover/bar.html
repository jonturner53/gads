<h1>Set Cover Problem<sup>&copy;</sup></h1>

An instance of the <i>set cover</i> problem consists of a
<i>base set</i> $A$ and a collection $S$ of subsets of $A$,
where each subset $s$ has a non-negative <i>weight</i> $w_s$.
The objective is to find a minimum weight selection of 
subsets that <i>covers</i> the base set. That is, every
item in the base set is included in at least one of the
selected subsets.
<p>
One can visualize the problem as a bipartite graph, where
the inputs represent the subsets, the outputs represent the
items in the base set and the edges define the items belonging
to each subset.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">

</div>
In this example, subsets $A$, $B$ and $C$ define a cover with weight 15.
Selecting $D$ in place of $B$ yields a cover of weight 10.
<p>
The set cover problem is $NP$-complete, hence it is useful to consider
approximation algorithms.

<h2>Lower Bounds </h2>

Lower bounds are useful for gauging how far a given solution is from
an optimum solution.
For the example in the introduction, it's easy to see that any
cover must have at least two subsets. Also, the lightest pair of
subsets has a combined weight of 5, so no cover can have a weight less than 5.
In general, one can determine the smallest number of subsets required,
by adding the largest set sizes until the total size is at least equal
to the size of the base set. If $q$ subsets are required, no cover can
have a weight less than that of the $q$ lightest subsets.
<p>
Another lower bound can be obtained using an alternate version of
the problem. Consider the graph representation of the set cover problem.
Now, replace the input weights with edge weights. Specifically, divide
the weight of each input equally among its incident edges.
The objective of this <i>split weights</i> variant is to find a 
least cost subset of the edges that includes at least one edge at
each output.
The figure below shows our earlier example on the left with the
subsets in one solution highlighted. The split weights version is shown
on the right, with the edges of a solution highlighted.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="50%" src="figs/lowerBound.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
It's trivial to compute an optimal solution to the split weights problem.
Simply select the least-cost edge at each output. An optimal solution to
the set cover problem can be viewed as a solution to the split weights
version that has the same or smaller cost.
Consequently, the cost of the split weights solution yields a
lower bound.
<p>
One can get a third lower bound by formulating the set cover problem
as an integer linear program.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\textrm{minimize} && \sum_{1\leq j \leq k} w_j x_j \\
\textrm{subject to} &&
\sum_{j:a_i\in s_j} x_j \geq 1 \qquad \textrm{for all $i$}
\end{eqnarray*}
where $S=\{s_j | 1\leq j \leq k\}$ is the collection of subsets on
the base set $A=\{a_i | 1 \leq i \leq h\}$,
$w_j$ is the weight of $s_j$ and
$x_j$ is a 0-1 selection variable that is set to 1 to include $s_j$ in a
solution.
The constraints ensure that each $a_i$ is included in at least one
subset of the solution.
The ordinary linear program obtained by relaxing the
integer requirement on the $x_j$s has an optimal solution
no larger than that of the integer program. Hence, the optimum value
of the LP objective function is a lower bound on the optimum set cover weight.

<h2>Using Linear Programs to Approximate Set Covers</h2>

The LP relaxation of the set cover integer program can be used to obtain
set covers that are close to optimal. The approximation takes
an LP solution and &ldquo;rounds&rdquo; its variables up or down
to obtain an integer solution.
Specifically, if $\mu$ is the maximum number of times that any item
appears in a subset, then every $x_j \geq 1/\mu$ is rounded up to 1,
while the rest are rounded down to 0.
The LP constraint for each item $a_i$ requires that
$\sum_{j:a_i\in s_j} x_j \geq 1$ and since this sum has at
most $\mu$ terms, at least one of the terms is $\geq 1/\mu$.
Consequently, the rounding operation ensures that the constraints
are satisfied in the integer solution as well and hence define
a set cover. Since each weight that is rounded up is increased by at
most a factor of $\mu$, the value of the integer solution is at most $\mu$
times that of the optimal LP solution.
This implies that the computed cover is most $\mu$ times heavier than
the optimal cover.
<p>
The rounding algorithm requires an optimal solution to the
LP relaxation, which can be time-consuming to compute.
Fortunately, there is also a primal-dual algorithm that achieves
the same bound without that computation.

The dual for the LP relaxation of the set cover problem is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\textrm{maximize} \sum_{1\leq i \leq n} y_i && \\
\textrm{subject to}
\sum_{i:a_i\in s_j} y_i &\leq& w_j \qquad \textrm{for all $j$} \\
y_i &\geq& 0 \qquad \textrm{for all $i$}
\end{eqnarray*}
where the dual variable $y_i$ is referred to as the <i>label</i>
of $y_i$.
The summation in the first constraint is referred to as the
<i>label sum</i> of $s_j$.
So the objective is to maximize the sum of the labels while
constraining each subset's label sum to be no more than its weight.
<p>
The primal-dual algorithm uses the dual constraints to guide the selection
of subsets. 
To be more specific, it starts by setting the $y_i$ to zero and
then repeats the following step.
<p style="padding-left:5%">
Select an item $a_i$ that is not yet covered and increase its 
label $y_i$ until the dual constraint for some subset $s_j$
containing $a_i$ is tight. Add $s_j$ to the cover.
<p>
When the algorithm halts, every subset in the cover has a tight
dual constraint, which implies that the weight of the cover is equal to
the combined total of the cover's label sums. Since each label appears
in at most $\mu$ label sums, this total is at most $\mu$ times the sum
of all labels. Because the sum of all labels is a lower bound on the
optimal cover weight, the computed cover's weight is at most $\mu$ times
the optimal weight.
<p>
Note that each step adds a subset to the cover and covers at least
one new item. So the number of steps is bounded by both $h$ and $k$.
The algorithm can be implemented to run in time bounded by the
total sum of the subset sizes.
A <i>Javascript</i> implementation of the algorithm is shown below.

export default function setCoverBYE(g, weight) {
    let k = g.inputCount(); let h = g.outputCount();

    let cover = new List(k);        // list of sets in current cover

            let j = g.mate(vi,e); slack[j] -= minSlack;
            if (!newSubset && slack[j] == 0) newSubset = j;
        }

    return [cover ..];

This implementation uses the bipartite graph representation of the
set cover; subsets are represented by the first $k$ positive
integers and the items by the next $h$.
To demonstrate the algorithm, enter the following script
in the web app.

<p> <pre style="padding-left:5%">
let [g, weight, props] = setCoverRandom(6,18,3,.5,randomInteger,2,9);
let [cover, weight, ts] = setCoverBYE(g, weight, 1);
log(ts, props.sizeBound, props.splitBound, props.labelBound,
        props.seedWeight, props.maxCover);
</pre> <p>
The function <i>setCoverRandom</i> returns a bipartite graph and
an array of subset weights. In this example, there are 6 subsets
and 18 items in the base set. The weights are random integers
between 2 and 9 and a cover with three subsets is
&ldquo;seeded&rdquo; within the instance and the weights of its subsets are
multiplied by 0.5. <i>SetCoverRandom</i> also returns five properties,
the first three are lower bounds on the minimum cover weight,
the label bound is the sum of the labels in the solution computed
by the primal-dual algorithm. The last two properties are the weight
of the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; and the number of subsets
that contain each item.

Some sample trace output appears below.
<p> <pre style="padding-left:5%">
graph: {
A:3[h i m p r s v w]
B:4[g l t]
C:1[j l o q s v]
D:4[i m n p r x]
E:1[g h k t u w]
F:5[j k n o q u x]
g[B E] h[A E] i[A D] j[C F] k[E F] l[B C]
m[A D] n[D F] o[C F] p[A D] q[C F] r[A D]
s[A C] t[B E] u[E F] v[A C] w[A E] x[D F]
}

uncovered items, slacks of first item's subsets, partial cover
[g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x] [B:4 E:1] [] 0
[i j l m n o p q r s v x] [A:3 D:4] [E:1] 1
[j l n o q x] [C:1 F:5] [E:1 A:3] 4
[n x] [D:1 F:4] [E:1 A:3 C:1] 5

cover: [E A C D] 9
</pre> <p>
The subsets are identified by upper case letters, the items in
the base set by lower case. So, the second subset $B$ has weight 4
and contains items $g$, $l$ and $t$ and item $g$ is contained in
subsets $B$ and $E$.
