<h1>Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles<sup>&copy;</sup></h1>

A Hamiltonian path (cycle) is a path (cycle) in a graph that
includes every vertex exactly once.
The problem of determining
if a graph is Hamiltonian is $NP$-complete,
however there are efficient methods that can work well on random graphs.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="23%" src="figs/example1.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Erdos and Renyi showed that almost all random graphs with fewer than
$\frac{1}{2} n \ln n$ edges are disconnected, but almost all graphs with
more than $\frac{1}{2} n \ln n$ are connected [ER59].
In 1976, Posa showed that for large enough constant $c$,
almost all graphs with $c n\ln n$ edges are Hamiltonian [Posa76],
and in 1983, Komlos and Szemeredi improved on this to show that
almost all graphs with more than $\frac{1}{2} n \ln n$ edges are [KS83].
Moreover, in 1994 Robinson and Wormald showed that almost all
$d$-regular graphs are Hamiltonian for all $d\geq 3$ [RW94].
So Hamiltonian paths and cycles are surprisingly common, even in
quite sparse graphs.

<h2>Extension-Rotation Method</h2>

Posa's proof that almost all graphs with $c n\ln n$ edges are Hamiltonian
includes a method for building a Hamiltonian path incrementally.
It uses two basic operations, path extension and rotation.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="60%" src="figs/extension-rotation.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
The extension operation simply adds an edge from the <i>free</i> endpoint of
the current partial path to a vertex not yet in the path.
The rotation uses an edge from the free endpoint to an interior vertex
to expose a new endpoint from which further path extension may be possible.
Angluin and Valiant built an explicit algorithm based on Posa's method.
It starts by fixing an <i>anchor</i> vertex, initializes the free
endpoint to be the same as the anchor, then repeats the following step.
<p style="padding-left:5%">
If the partial path constructed so far contains all vertices and there
is an edge connecting the free endpoint to the anchor, add the edge to close
the cycle and terminate successfully.
Otherwise, select an <i>unmarked edge</i> $e=\{u,v\}$ incident to the
free endpoint $u$ and delete it from the graph.
If there is no edge in the graph at $u$, terminate with a failure.
<ul style="padding-left:8%">
<li>
If $v$ is not on the current path,
add $\{u,v\}$ to the end of the path, making $v$ the new free endpoint.
<li>
If $v$ is an internal vertex on the current path,
use $\{u,v\}$ to rotate the path, exposing a new free endpoint.
</ul>
<p>
Edges are selected randomly and the deletion of selected edges ensures
that no edge is selected more than once.
<p>
A <i>Javascript</i> implementation of this algorithm appears below.

    // select random anchor u0 and let u be the free endpoint
    let u0 = randomInteger(1,g0.n); let u = u0;

This abridged version omits a couple features of the program in the
provided library.
Specifically, the provided version also supports the construction of a
Hamiltonian path between two specified vertices or the construction of a
path starting at a specified vertex, but ending anywhere.
It also allows edges to be selected multiple times (up to a specified maximum),
enabling it to find Hamiltonian paths or cycles that the basic version may not.
The following script can be used to demonstrate the algorithm.
<p> <pre style="padding-left:5%">
let g = hpcRandom(10, 3);
let [path,ts,stats] = hpcPAV(g,1,0,0,1);
log(ts + (stats.length==g.n ? 'success' : 'failure'));
</pre> <p>
The function <i>hpcRandom</i> returns a random graph that
contains a Hamiltonian cycle and has
10 vertices and average vertex degree 3.
Here is the output from a sample (successful) execution of the script.
<p> <pre style="padding-left:5%">
graph: {
a[h j f]  b[h e c g]  c[d f b]  d[c j]
e[i h b]  f[c a]  g[h b i]  h[e g b a]
i[e j g]  j[a i d]
}

vertices on partial paths from d with selected edge
[d j a f c b g i] {j,i}
[d j i g b c f a h e] {e,b}

final cycle: [dj ji ig bg eb he ha af fc cd]
success
</pre> <p>
The trace output shows the vertices on each partial path
just before each rotation operation.
In this case, the first seven steps extended the path.
Then, there was a rotation that reversed the order of
the last six vertices on the path, exposing $a$ as the
new free endpoint. This rotation was
followed by two more path extensions, followed by a rotation
that reversed the order of the last five vertices,
exposing $c$.
The last step closed the cycle with edge $\{c,d\}$.
<p>
Increasing the second argument of <i>hpcPAV</i> to 2 allows
each edge to be selected twice. Here is an example showing the
effect of this change, with an asterisk marking the edges selected
for the second time.
<p> <pre style="padding-left:5%">
graph: {
a[b f c]  b[a j i g]  c[d e g j a]  d[h i c]

[h d i b j e g c a] {c,a}*

From this example, it's not obvious that allowing multiple edge
selections is productive, but as will be shown, it can boost
performance substantially.

To generate and then attempt to find a graph with a Hamiltonian path
joining vertices $b$ and $e$, use this version of the script.

Observe that when the selection limit is 1, the algorithm is unable to
find the Hamiltonian cycles that are present in the graphs of small degree.
For graphs with average degree 16,
it is able to find the cycles roughly half the time.
Increasing the limit to 2 allows it to match this performance level
for degree 12 graphs. Further increases enable it to reach this
performance level for degree values as small as 5, a three-to-one
improvement over the $\selectLimit=1$ case.
Also, note that in most cases, the number of rotations is smaller than
the number of edges and it is never than four times the number of edges,
even when the selection limit is 20.
So the improved performance can be obtained with a relatively modest
increase in computational effort.
<p>
The following script uses binary search to find the smallest average degree
for which cycles are found at least half the time.
<p> <pre style="padding-left:5%">
let n = 800; let selectLimit = 10;
let successCount = 0; let rotations = 0; let k = 10;
let lo = 3; let hi = 30; let dmin=0;
while (lo < hi) {
    let success = 0;
    let d = ~~((lo+hi)/2);
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        let g = hpcRandom(n,d);
        let [path] = hpcPAV(g,selectLimit);
        if (path[g.n-1]) success++;
    }
    if (success/k < 0.5) lo = d+1;
    else { hi = d; dmin = d; }
}
log(`hpcPAV n=${n} selectLimit=${selectLimit} dmin=${dmin}`);
</pre> <p>
Here are some results showing how the minimum vertex degree
increases with the number of vertices.
<p> <pre style="padding-left:5%">
hpcPAV n= 50 selectLimit= 1 dmin=12 
hpcPAV n=100 selectLimit= 1 dmin=16 
hpcPAV n=200 selectLimit= 1 dmin=18 
hpcPAV n=400 selectLimit= 1 dmin=23 
hpcPAV n=800 selectLimit= 1 dmin=24 

hpcPAV n= 50 selectLimit=10 dmin= 6 
hpcPAV n=100 selectLimit=10 dmin= 6 
hpcPAV n=200 selectLimit=10 dmin= 7 
hpcPAV n=400 selectLimit=10 dmin= 8 
hpcPAV n=800 selectLimit=10 dmin= 9
</pre> <p>
Observe that when $\selectLimit=1$, each doubling of $n$
produces an average increase of 3 in <i>dmin</i>.
The incremental difference appears essentially constant,
suggesting a logarithmic growth rate.
Note that the random graph generator guarantees that there
is a Hamiltonian cycle in all cases, so these results imply that the
algorithm struggles to find cycles until the higher density
makes them more plentiful.
When $\selectLimit=10$, each doubling of $n$
produces an average increase of about 0.75 in <i>dmin</i>.
<p>
One can easily modify the script to use the <i>randomGraph</i>
function in place of <i>hpcRandom</i>. This produces larger
<i>dmin</i> values.
Alternatively, <i>randomRegularGraph</i> produces smaller values.
These differences are consistent with the differences in the variance of
the vertex degrees in the different random graph models.
In general, one can expect performance to deteriorate as variance increases.

<h2>Cycle Patching Method</h2>

The <i>traveling salesman problem</i> can be viewed as a generalization
of the Hamiltonian cycle problem.
In this case, edges have costs and the objective is to find a simple
cycle that visits all the vertices and has minimum cost.
Reference [Karp79] describes a <i>patching</i> algorithm for the
nonsymmetric version of the traveling salesman problem.
He shows that if costs are selected uniformly in $[0,1]$ for all ordered pairs
of vertices $(u,v)$, that the patching algorithm produces near-optimal
solutions with high probability.
<p>
Karp's algorithm starts by finding a minimum cost collection of
disjoint cycles. This can be done by solving a weighted matching problem on
a complete bipartite graph and the cost of the collection of cycles
is guaranteed to be no larger than that of the least-cost Hamiltonian
cycle. The disjoint cycles can be combined into a Hamiltonian cycle
by applying a pairwise patching operation, and if the patching
operations are chosen judiciously, the final cost is not much
larger than that of the initial collection.
<p>
The cycle patching idea can be adapted to the Hamiltonian cycle problem,
but some changes are needed to account for the differences between the
two problems. There are two main issues. First, in the Hamilotonian cycle
context, the graphs are undirected, meaning that edges can be used in either
direction. Second there are no edge costs.
Finally, the problem is trivial for complete graphs and is only challenging
in sparse graphs where solutions can be hard to find.
Still, the basic framework of Karp's algorithm remains relevant.
The first part is to construct a collection of disjoint cycles that
includes every vertex. The second part is to patch the cycles together,
using a variant of Karp's patching method that is suited to
undirected graphs.
<p>
An initial collection of cycles can be obtained using essentially the
same method that Karp uses. However, because the graph is undirected
and has no edge costs, this method tends to produce lots of small cycles,
not all of which can be readily patched into other cycles. For this
reason, a better approach is to construct a degree-constrained
subgraph of maximum size with a degree upper bound of two for every vertex.
If the number of edges in this subgraph equals the number of vertices,
the subgraph defines cycles that partition the vertices.
If the subgraph has too few edges, then the graph cannot contain
a Hamiltonian cycle.
<p>
Once an initial set of cycles is found, the algorithm identifies
<i>compatible pairs</i> of cycles and combines them to form larger cycles,
continuing until only one cycle remains, or none of the remaining
cycles are compatible. Call two vertices on the same cycle <i>buddies</i>
if they are adjacent on the cycle.
Two cycles $C_1$ and $C_2$ are compatible if they contain
vertices $u$ and $v$, where $u$ is adjacent to a buddy of $v$
and $v$ is adjacent to a buddy of $u$.
This is illustrated below.

A variant of the script used earler can be
used to demonstrate the algorithm. Here is some sample
trace output.
<p> <pre style="padding-left:5%">

e[d a]  f[h k]  g[m l]  h[f o]

}

{[e a c n d] [b i o h f k p j l g m]}

final cycle: [ea ac cn no oh hf fk pk jp jl lg gm mb bi id de] 16
</pre> <p>
The trace output shows the cycles at the start of each iteration
of the main loop. For small examples like this, the intial collection
of cycles is often a single cycle, allowing the main loop to be skipped.
In this case, the initial collection has two cycles, which are
combined yielding the final result.
<p>
For larger graphs, more iterations typically occur.
Terse trace output showing only the lengths of the cycles appears below.
This output is for two different random graphs on 200 vertices with
average degree 8.

The cycle lengths are shown at the start of each iteration of the main
loop and at the end of execution.
In the first case, the first two cycles are combined on each iteration,
leading to a single cycle at the end.
In the second case, the cycles remaining at the end could not be
combined and the program failed to find a solution.

The results below were obtained using a variant of the earlier binary search
script. They show the smallest average vertex degree for which the
algorithm found a Hamiltonian circuit in at least half of the cases it tried.

hpcKT n= 50 dmin=3 
hpcKT n=100 dmin=4 
hpcKT n=200 dmin=5 
hpcKT n=400 dmin=6 
hpcKT n=800 dmin=8 
</pre> <p>
This is a bit better than <i>hpcPAV</i> for the smaller graphs,
even when the selection limit is quite large.
For larger graphs, the performance of the two is roughly comparable.
<p>
The complete implementation of <i>hpcKT</i> includes code to support
Hamiltonian paths as well as cycles. This is done using a general reduction
from the Hamilonian path problem to the Hamiltonian cycle problem.
When both $s$ and $t$ are specified, an extra vertex is added to the
graph with edges connecting it to both $s$ and $t$. The original
graph has a Hamiltonian path if and only if the augmented graph
has a Hamiltonian cycle. A variant of this reduction can be used
if $t$ is left unspecified.
