<h1>Traveling Salesman Problem<sup>&copy;</sup></h1>

The <i>traveling salesman problem</i> (TSP) is perhaps the best-known,
and certainly one of the most studied
<i>NP</i>-hard combinatorial optimization problems [LLRS95].
An instance consists of a set of cities with inter-city distances
$d_{ij}\geq 0$ defined for each distinct pair.
Distances may be <i>symmetric</i> ($d_{ij} = d_{ji}$) or <i>asymmetric</i>,
and will often satisfy the <i>triangle inequality</i>
($d_{ik} \leq d_{ij} + d_{jk}$).
The objective is to find a cycle passing through all the cities
(called a <i>tour</i>) that has minimum total length.
<p>
One can also represent the problem using a graph, where the vertices
represent cities and the edge weights represent inter-city distances.
For non-adjacent vertices, the inter-city distances can be defined
using some rule.
For example, one might define them to be the shortest path distances
in the graph, or one might make them infinite.
<p>
A solution to a TSP instance can be expressed as a list of vertices
that includes every vertex exactly once. The length of the tour is
the sum of the distances linking successive vertices.
Alternatively, it can be expressed as a list of the graph edges used
to pass through the cities in the list.

<p>
Not only is the problem of finding an optimum TSP solution $NP$-hard,
the problem of finding a good worst-case approximation is also $NP$-hard.
Fortunately, there are important special cases for which approximate
solutions are possible, and even in the more general case,
there are algorithms that work well on random graphs.

<h2>Symmetric TSP with Triangle Inequality</h2>
When the inter-city distances are symmetric and satisfy the triangle
inequality, is possible to get good approximations to an optimal tour.
One such approximation is based on the observation that a minimum spanning tree
on the weighted graph defined by a TSP instance has total weight
no larger than the minimum tour length (since removing any edge from
a TSP tour yields an MST). 
<p>
Doubling the edges of an MST yields an Eulerian graph in which every
vertex has even degree. An Euler tour of a such a graph is a cycle
that uses all its edges, and can be constructed in time
proportional to the number of edges.
An Euler tour can be converted to a TSP tour by simply listing the
vertices in the order in which they first appear in the Euler tour.
Since the TSP distances satisfy the triangle inequality, the length
of the TSP tour can be no more than the length of the Euler tour,
and consequently no more than twice the length of an optimal TSP tour.
<p>
Christofides algorithm [Christofides76] is a refinement of the MST
approximation that uses a different Eulerian graph.
Specifically, Christofides algorithm computes a complete graph on the
MST vertices of odd degree and assigning each edge a weight equal to
the shortest path distance joining its endpoints in the TSP graph.
If the edges in a perfect matching on this graph are added to the
edges in the MST, the resulting graph is Eulerian. If the perfect matching
has minimum weight, its weight is at most half the length of
an optimal TSP tour. So the weight of the Eulerian graph constructed
using a minimum weight matching is at most
50% larger than the optimal tour length.
<p>
A <i>Javascript</i> implementation of this algorithm appears below.

Note that the TSP problem is specified as a graph which need not be complete
and the returned value includes all the edges on the computed tour.
If the provided graph is not complete, the tour may include
&ldquo;implicit edges&rdquo; that were not explicitly present in the
graph. Any such edges that are needed to complete the tour are
added to the graph and assigned a length equal to the
shortest path distance between the endpoints.
This ensures that the graph and the tour are consistent with one another.
<p>
The following script can be used to demonstrate the program.
<p> <pre style="padding-left:5%">
let n = 12; let d = 3; let scale = .5; let wtmax = 9;
let [g,seed,seedLength] = tspRandom(n,d,scale,[randomInteger,1,wtmax]);
let [[u0,tour], ts, stats] = tspC(g, 1);
log(ts + `\nseed: ${g.elist2string(seed,0,0,1)} ${seedLength}\n` +
         `\nfinal graph: ${g.toString(1)}`);
</pre> <p>
The function <code>tspRandom</code> generates a random graph with a
built-in &ldquo;seed tour&rdquo;.
Edges are assigned a random weight and the edge weights
on the tour are then multipled by a scale factor of 0.5.
Finally, any edge weights that violate the triangle inequality are
adjusted to comply with it. The returned value includes the generated
graph and the length of the built-in tour.
Here is a sample output from the script.

</pre> <p>
The trace output shows the edges in the MST and their total weight,
the edges in the matching and the final tour. The seed tour
built into the random graph is also shown, along with the final
version of the graph. Note that the tour includes edge $he$
which was not explicitly represented in the original graph, but is included
in the final version of the graph.
<p>
The length of the computed tour is about 6% less than the total
weight of the MST and matching and about 6% larger than the length
of the seed.
The MST implies a lower bound of 27 on the length of an
optimal tour.
The actual optimal tour length lies somewhere between this
lower bound and the length of the seed.
<p>
Here are some results for a larger graph (100 vertices and 500 edges)
with a scale factor of .1 and a maximum edge weight of 99.
The resulting seed tour lengths range from 493 to 547.

The computed tour lengths range from 524 to 587 and the ratios
of the tour lengths to the lower bounds range from 1.39 to 1.43.
The ratios of the computed tour lengths to the seed tour lengths
range from 1.05 to 1.1.

<h2>Unrestricted TSP</h2>

In the unrestricted version of the traveling salesman problem,
distances between cities may be asymmetric and the triangle inequality
may be be violated. This makes the problem considerably more difficult
in the worst-case. In fact, if there were a polynomial time algorithm that
could guarantee a solution with length within any constant factor of
the optimum tour length, it would imply that <i>P=NP</i>.
So in this case, the only recourse is algorithms that can be expected
to work well in practice. One such algorithm was devoloped by Karp,
who showed that on large random TSP instances, it could produce tours
close to optimal in length with high probability [Karp79].
<p>
Karp's algorithm starts by first solving a weighted
bipartite matching problem. Specifically, if the TSP is defined by
a weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges,
the bipartite graph $B=(W,F)$ has $2n$ vertices and $m$ edges,
where for each edge $(v_i,v_j)\in E$ there is a corresponding edge
$(w_i,w_{n+j})\in F$. A minimum weight matching in $B$ defines
a minimum length collection of vertex-disjoint cycles in $G$.
Since a TSP tour is a special case of such a collection,
the length of the optimum TSP tour can be no smaller than
the weight of such a matching. This is illustrated below.
Note that the edge lengths are identified by the edge colors.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="80%" src="figs/tspExample2.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
What remains is to combine the cycles into a single tour using a
<i>patching operation</i>. If two distinct cycles contain edges
$(u,v)$ and $(x,y)$ and there are also edges
<i>cross edges</i> $(u,y)$ and $(x,v)$, the cycles can be combined
by replacing $(u,v)$ and $(x,y)$ with the cross edges, at a cost
equal to the difference in length between the two edge pairs.
This is illustrated below
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="25%" src="figs/tspExample3.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Karp showed how to select the patching operations by solving a
second bipartite matching problem $P$ with a vertex for each
of the &ldquo;small cycles&rdquo; and
another for each of the edges in the large cycle. For every edge $(u,v)$
in a small cycle $c$ that can be used with an edge $(x,y)$ in the large
cycle to combine the two, an edge from $c$ to $(x,y)$ is included in $P$.
The weight of this edge is the incremental cost of the patching operation.
If a maximum size matching of minimum weight on $P$ matches every
small cycle, then the matching gives a minimum cost strategy for patching
all the small cycles into the large one.
The earlier example is continued below, showing the patching graph with edges
joining the cycle [<i>de ed</i>] to the large cycle at edge $ca$ and
cycle [<i>gf$\,$ fg</i>] at edge $bc$. In this case the patching graph is a
matching, and both small cycles can be patched into the large one.
The right side of the figure shows how one patching operation replaces
the cycle edges $ed$ and $ca$ with the cross edges $ea$ and $cd$.
<p>
<div  style="text-align:center;">
<img width="60%" src="figs/tspExample4.png"><br>
</div>
<p>
Completing the second patching operation produces the tour
[<i>ab bf fg gc cd de ea</i>] with a total length of 15.
Note that the optimum tour is [<i>ae ed dc cg gf fb ba</i>] 
which has length 12 and that Karp's algorithm produces the same result
even if the lengths of edges $cd$ and $gc$ are arbitrarily large.
So, it cannot approximate the optimum tour within any constant bound.
On the other hand,
Karp showed that for very large complete random graphs with uniformly
distributed edge weights, the largest cycle defined by the matching includes
most of the vertices in the graph with high probability and that the
limited number of smaller cycles can patched into the largest with only a
small cost penalty.
<p>
A <i>Javascript</i> implementation of Karp's algorithm is shown below.
This implementation extends Karp's algorithm in two ways. First, if
the standard matching process is unable to combine all the cycles into one,
then a second attempt is made to merge the remaining small cycles.
This second attempt repeatedly looks for the least cost patching opportunity
between the small cycles and the large one, and carries out the corresponding
patching operation. It can sometimes succeed when the original algorithm
fails, since it can take advantage of new patching opportunities that
may arise from earlier patching operations.
<p>
If the second attempt to complete the tour fails,
the remaining cycles are merged with the large one by extending the
initial graph with edges of infinite length that can be used as
cross edges in patching operations. This is equivalent to the
interpretation that the &ldquo;missing edges&rdquo; are just a
way of representing infinite inter-city distances.

The program can be demonstrated using the following script.
<p> <pre style="padding-left:5%">
let n = 12; let d = 4; let scale = .5;
let [g,seed,seedLength] = tspRandom(n,d,scale,[randomInteger,1,9],1,0);
let [[u0,tour],ts] = tspK(g,1);
log(ts + `\nseed: ${g.elist2string(tour,0,0,1)} ${seedLength}\n`);
</pre> <p>
The <code>tspRandom</code> function call uses two additional arguments.
The first specifies that the returned graph should define an
asymmetric instance (implying a directed graph).
The second specifies that the edge lengths need not satisfy
the triangle inequality.
A sample result appear below.
<p> <pre style="padding-left:5%">
graph: {
a[e:1] b[c:3 k:5] c[d:3 g:4 h:5 i:3 j:3]
d[b:1 e:4 f:5 h:5 k:4] e[c:6 h:6 i:5 k:2] f[a:5 b:4 c:4 i:6]
g[a:8 c:4 f:6 i:8 j:5 k:3 l:5] h[d:6 g:6 i:3] i[c:7 j:3 k:8 l:4]
j[b:4 c:3] k[b:4 e:6 f:2 h:2 i:2] l[a:7 f:5 g:3 h:6 i:1 k:7]
}

initial cycles: b[bc cd dh hi ij jb] a[ae ek kf fa] g[gl lg] 39

potential patching edge sets
    ek bc ec bk 6
    ek dh eh dk 3
    kf dh kh df 0
    gl ij gj il 1
    lg hi li hg 1

updated cycle sets
    a[ae ek kh hi ij jb bc cd df fa] g[gl lg] 39
    a[ae ek kh hg gl li ij jb bc cd df fa] 40

tsp tour: a[ae ek kh hg gl li ij jb bc cd df fa] 40

seed: a[ae ek kh hg gl li ij jb bc cd df fa] 40
</pre> <p>
In this case, the intial collection of cycles includes three cycles,
with a total length of 39.
Each cycle is shown as a list of edges, preceded by its initial vertex.
The edge groups that define potential patching operations are shown,
along with the incremental cost of each operation.
The first of the small cycles can be
patched into the large one in three different ways.
The second can be patched in two different ways.
The collection of cycles is shown after each patching operation,
with the updated length. The computed tour turns out to be the seed tour.
<p>
The following script can be used to explore how the algorithm performs
under different conditions.
<p> <pre style="padding-left:5%">
let n = 100; let d = 15; let scale = .1; let wtmax = 99;
let [g,seed,seedLength] = tspRandom(n,d,scale,[randomInteger,1,wtmax],1,0);
let t = Date.now(); let [[u0,tour], ts, stats] = tspK(g); t = Date.now() - t;
log(n, d, scale, wtmax, 'cycleStats=['+stats.cycleStats+']', 
    'perfRatio='+(stats.tourLength/stats.cycleStats[2]).toFixed(2), 
    'seedLength='+seedLength, t+'ms');
</pre> <p>
Some sample results are shown below. Each group of four uses the same
parameters and gives some sense of the performance variability.
As the graph density is increased, the scale factor for the seed tour
is decreased. The <code>cycleStats</code> include the initial length
of the largest cycle, the number of cycles and the total length of the initial
set of cycles. The performance ratio
is the ratio of the computed tour length to the length of the initial cycles.

</pre> <p>
At very low densities, the algorithm usually discovers the seed tour in
the first step. However, when the initial set of cycles is shorter than
the seed tour, it is likely to be unable to patch the cycles together
without adding infinite length cross edges.
This occurs more often at slightly higher densities, but then becomes less
frequent as the densities continue to increase (as there are more cross edges
available for patching).
When the algorithm produces a finite length tour, its length is usually
close to the lower bound, regardless of the graph density.
